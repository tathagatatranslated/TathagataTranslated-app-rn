I got this particular translation of Tathagata's book of poetry from the website http://www.snasc.com/traveler/traveler.htm 

I, and another native Korean speaking long-time member who traveled with Tathagata unlike me, noticed a number of non-optimal translations in this version. So we corresponded some years ago to produce a new translation for this book of poetry, which can be found within the 'New Translations' section.
