# Transcribing Tathagata

## Contents

Contained herein are select transcriptions of audio recordings of philosophy, science, etc. talks and conversations with a philosopher who referred to himself as Tathagata.

I had initially published this content on a website called Posterous at "https://teachingoftathagata.posterous.com" but the company closed down, so I had to search for new hosting. I was also discouraged by a society member from posting the transcriptions since some of them contained personal information, even though I was especially careful not to include any of it. So I unpublished it for some time. Later, I republished it on GitHub at https://github.com/enlightenmentapp/Transcription.

I've taken the same content from that website and republished it in a readable form here.




## "Why People Don't Want to See Him"

Sometime shortly after 2010, after my showing strong and continued interest in the teachings of the great traveling philosopher and self-claimed Enlightened master Tathagata for many years, I became the recipient of a DVD of many audio recordings made of this master's travels around the world – specifically those from his 2004 travels to Thailand and 2007 travel to USA the year before his death.

During this traveling of Tathagata's, he would visit religious leaders, professors, prominent members of society (such as politicians), journalists, and so on. He would do so, in my understanding, in order to contribute his special and exceedingly rare knowledge and information to humanity for its present and its future – to prevent the world's destruction and to bless its future with solutions people have sought for thousands of years. It seems that he found that the people in high positions didn't really understand the substance of their own fields of study, meanwhile, he was able to answer the questions that people posed to him in those fields. He claimed to be able to reveal the truth of any field and that he could perceive everything in the world. Listening to the recordings, most obviously his discussions about philosophy and religious / spiritual matters, this was unarguably apparent to me. 

During his 2004 Thailand travels, Tathagata was accompanied by long-time disciple, Buddhist nun, and interpreter, Soyun, plus a traveling companion and acting audio engineer named Satto (aka Alberto), plus an Australian individual named Dominique (spelling unknown). During the trip, Dominique was considering writing a book to hold written accounts of these travels of Tathagata. At a certain point while they were all relaxing in their hotel and talking, Soyun remarked to Dominique with a laugh (paraphrased from memory), "Ah, the Master has given you a title for your book: 'Why People Don't Want to See Him'." So I thought I would use that title for this section.


---------------------

Within the next year after receipt of these recordings, having listened to them many, many times, and having continuously refined my understanding of the words therein, I began to think of what service I could do with this beautiful content. 

The thought occurred to me: not everyone can easily listen to the back-and-forth Korean-English translations that are happening in the audio files. Plus, it takes a lot of time and effort to listen carefully, and, it's not always easy to make out the words... people might misunderstand some things, lose their patience, leave, etc., and miss out on crucial information which is not published anywhere else. In addition there are some who simply don't have the ability listen to audio such as the hearing-impaired. 

So the plan of transcribing certain parts of the recordings which I thought were particularly interesting or useful began to form within me, and shortly after, I began to carry it out.


## Note from the Publisher

Any statements in parentheses (like this) found in this section are revised or alternate translations of Master Tathagata's words given by the interpreter at the time within the recording itself. 

Important: I have made about five to ten minor conjugation-related revisions to improve English readability only whenever I felt absolutely certain it would not change the meaning. Besides those few cases, especially since I do not know Korean natively and given the importance of maintaining the integrity Tathagata's exact words, I did not change any words, nor add any of my own words, nor try to correct any translations, and I was very careful to write down only exactly what I heard in the recording. I did have to make a few guesses and tried to point it out if I had trouble understanding it.

Please keep in mind that I also could not tell the degree of accuracy of the translation as I can't speak Korean. So these transcriptions really need to be confirmed through Master's original words in Korean.

In case I had to include any transcription notes inline with the content of the recording, I made them very clear by using square brackets [like this].
