## Translating Tathagata



### NOTICE

This section contains translations which were made made (for the most part) by people who are *completely unfamiliar* with any of Tathagata's teachings. Therefore we don't vouch for the correctness and completeness of any of the translations, and in fact expect there to be multiple errors among them. 

The translations this section contains were, dangerously, made after the death of Tathagata. They were also, with the exception of 'Traveler', *never* checked by any members of the Society of Natural Science. Read them with extreme caution.

If you would like to work on your own translation of any of Tathagata's words, it's *essential* that new translations be made only from the original Korean, in order to help prevent introduction of compounded inaccuracies, the erosion of true meanings, or the degeneration or modification of the truth left by Tathagata. Additionally, always make sure you include the original Korean text for readers. It's additionally helpful to provide as much notice about who made the translation and disclose all related details and context when possible to prepare readers with the understanding that there is a difference between the accuracy and precision of the translation and the original words and that they were not made by someone who met Tathagata.

At the time of writing this there does remain some untranslated content. A revision-tracking repository for the new translations project is located at https://github.com/TranslatingTathagata/Translations - and this website's source code directly embeds that repository as a submodule.
