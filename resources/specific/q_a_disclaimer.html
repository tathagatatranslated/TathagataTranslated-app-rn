<h2>About These Questions and Answers</h2>

<p>These questions reportedly were asked by visitors to the 'Enlightenment of Tathagata' website when the Master Tathagata was available to receive questions over email before his death in 2008.</p>
<p>I hear these questions were translated from English into Korean, with his answers translated back from Korean to English for the reply.</p>
<p>I can attest I personally fabricated two of the names contained here and received replies via email and via the published site at that time.</p>
<p>Years after Tathagata's death, I was informed that a member actually made up a number of names and sent in fabricated questions, probably without Tathagata's knowledge. Upon my reading of some of the questions after the fact, I could imagine some double-meanings of the answers that made me wonder if Tathagata was in fact aware of it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's beneficial to disclose this fact but it seemed prudent for readers to know that the number of people who were moved to approach Tathagata via email is probably therefore less than appearances.</p>
