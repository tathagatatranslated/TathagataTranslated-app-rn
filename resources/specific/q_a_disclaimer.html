<h2>About These Questions and Answers</h2>

<p>These questions were claimed to have been asked over email by visitors to the original 'Enlightenment of Tathagata' website, while the Master Tathagata was available to receive questions before his death in 2008.</p>
<p>The questions are assumed to have been translated from English into Korean, with his answers translated back from Korean to English for the reply.</p>
<p>In the past, I had personally made up two of the names contained here for email correspondence with Master Tathagata and received replies via email and via the published 'Enlightenment' site in those days. Initially, under my real name, at a young age upon first finding the 'Enlightenment' site, I was looking to have my thought that I had attained an enlightenment validated. The reply and a common theme I got from the website maintainer, Paul Iddon, who trained me somewhat over the subsequent years, was that I must be disillusioned as it is predetermined that only a single Supremely Enlightened being appears in the human world once in about every 3000 years. At the very least I think this preparation helped me open my mind to the potential full scope of the perceptual abilities of a completely enlightened being, if such a thing were in fact real.</p>
<p>I've heard multiple other questions were fabricated by another individual as well, but for the different reported reason of lifting Tathagata's spirits. Re-reading the questions after learning of this, and perhaps in overanalysis, I began to wonder if Tathagata might in fact have been aware of it and replied occasionally with double meanings.</p>
