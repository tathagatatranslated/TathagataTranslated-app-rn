<h2>Introduction to Tathagata's Enlightenment</h2>

<p><strong>Tathagata, the man with the Third Eye (the eye of wisdom), has come.</strong></p>
<p>Who is he?<br/>
Why did he have to come to us?</p>
<p>How did he attain Enlightenment?</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Message from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I have been travelling endlessly for the wishes of the human world. </p>
<p>I can tell various cases operating for the world to exist, which nobody has known so far. </p>
<p>I can tell what has existed in life and the effect of what happens in the life of individuals. </p>
<p>I am aware of the world of gods which has not been revealed by anyone.</p>
<p>I know the substance of eschatology which has been said to happen in this era. </p>
<p>I can introduce <em>'uitong'</em> which will be a new visionary medicine. <em>Uitong</em> makes diagnoses and treatments for a great number of diseases possible, without using any medicines or medical instruments. </p>
<p>I can answer to a wide range of problems in the human world and I can provide the solutions on the spot. </p>
<p>I hope that my activities will be helpful to many people and sincerely request your verification of my truth.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<br/>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Note from the Publisher</p>

<p>On April 6, 1942, Enlightened Master Tathagata was born in South Korea. He passed away on August 21st, 2008 in Malaysia.</p>

<p>I have compiled this app to serve as place to collect and publish all known textual content left for us by Tathagata.</p> 

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer</span>: Tathagata spoke virtually no English, aside from the odd word here and there. So all of the contents from him which are here, aside from those under "New Translations", have been translated from Tathagata's native language of Korean into English by members. I just copied them as-is.</p>

<p>Reading the translations alone, especially without your having contact with a person who received training from Tathagata (the only real Enlightened Being in almost 3,000 years since Gautama Buddha) can only serve as a basic introduction to the true meanings of His teachings. Reading them in Korean as a native speaker with full context would generally be superior.</p>

<p>The other contents under "New Translations" were produced by people who are unfamiliar with Tathagata and merely spoke Korean, or were produced after Tathagata died, and therefore were not checked with him. Everything published here should be considered very carefully and your initial impression of its meaning should not necessarily be believed. For example, after reading Chapter 8. 'Law of Cause and Effect' from His book of poetry Traveler for almost a decade, it was only after some changes in my life that I began to read many of the poems with greater meanings.</p>
