# Publisher's Note

I, an English speaker, asked some AI software to translate this into English.

I made multiple translations and they came out materially differently each time.

The prompt I used for the following translation asked the translator to tell the truth, not make up anything, and to translate directly, but to make a translation which actually can be understood in English (since some phrases do not intelligibly translate when truly literal.)

But sometimes AI makes stuff up, and I am unable to verify or vouch for this translation, so beware of taking it as canonical or authoritative or even true to the original content.

It would be a great and worthwhile goal for someone who speaks Korean natively to carefully check this translation and to please suggest to this publisher any corrections they might like to see made.

Original Korean source material follows English translation.

**Yoon So-yeon**

**Opening of Dalma-won, the House of Enlightenment**


March 5, 1989, Dalma-won (House of Enlightenment) opened its doors.

The master told the bodhisattvas and good spirits in heaven above and earth below about this matter and instructed them to dedicate their merit and grace to this work.

He said that here the path of Buddha would open again and all the energy of heaven would gather in this place.

The most difficult and regrettable thing was that the enlightened one wanted to teach what was right but there was no one to learn, he wanted to guide but there was no one to follow.

Though many were invited, only about 30 people attended.

Heavy snow that isn't even seen in winter was pouring down in March. Snow flower rain.

I saw brilliant blessings.

I believe in heaven's will, believe in the master, and believe in my good heart.

When the master first attained enlightenment, there was a message transmitted from heaven through his heart.

If you know the truth, you will be lonely.
If you speak the truth, you will be cursed.
The loneliness and curses seen in the world are expected. But the truth must be spoken. For those who seek it.

March 6, 1989, around 10 AM, the master came to Dalma-won.

"Tomorrow I'll go to Seoul. But I don't really know where to go. There's nowhere to go. During my lifetime, people don't seem likely to like me. The blind believe the words of the blind and the blind get along well with each other. They rather fear and doubt those with eyes. The master with the world's highest wisdom has nowhere to go, becoming women's plaything at dance halls, sitting behind card games watching them to pass time with nowhere to spend time - this will touch the heartstrings of future generations! How ruined are the hearts of people in this era! With nowhere to dedicate my true heart, I wander and despair daily. No matter what, I must meet all those with outstanding wisdom in the world and make them submit. If I lose even once, then I'll abandon the work of saving the world. And I'll return to where I came from. Soyeon, don't look at yourself. Dedicate your whole heart and body to serving only the world. That alone is the way to live. Guiding one person to the world of truth is the way to save one life."

I called my old friend Eunseong. She is currently a teacher and has been Protestant for 15 years and Catholic for 10 years. She said:

"I've heard the words 'end times' and 'salvation' until my ears hurt. The reason is probably because my heart knows I cannot be saved."

"If you know that, there's possibility. If you don't save yourself in this era, you might lose yourself forever. You mustn't give up. Eunseong must wake up and see all facts correctly. It's not possible to save your good self through wrong perceptions and incorrect teachings."

It won't be easy for the framework of existing concepts deeply embedded in her to break. And without desperate effort to break through that framework, it will be difficult to see one's true self.

The master went to Seoul to meet religious researchers and get opportunities to lecture at religious colleges. He came back deflated. People just avoided him with various excuses.

The master said:

"Those addicted to opium fear most being told to quit opium. Teaching truth to wrong humans is like this. Soyeon, pray to meet righteous people. Ah! This work is truly difficult. If not me, no one can do this work. If I hadn't attained liberation, I would have been killed or killed myself already. I came to this earth to see glory but humans treat me only with contempt, coldness, and indifference. I'm tired. I want to return."

I encouraged the master:

"It's only been 5 years since you attained enlightenment. You still have over twenty more years to remain in the world. It's too early to be tired or give up."

Anguish
A day's time is too frightening
A year's time is vain.
For whom do I
Know this life of anguish.
With regrettable things before my eyes
Today too I anguished with nowhere to go.

The master's poems are mantras. His words and his life are one. He speaks that way and lives that way. He lives that way and speaks that way. The master's words are all confirmed in the world.

The enlightened one. Because he sees facts and teaches facts. And in a world without truth, the most rejected thing is speaking facts. Because it provides no comfort.

I went around visiting people trying to convey blessings. I approached even those who weren't welcoming with a smiling face. There were people whose hearts' doors I never wanted to knock on again.

The master said:
"Liu Bei bent his waist three times visiting Zhuge Liang to achieve his will. If even worldlings do this, what's wrong with a seeker bending their waist ten times? If you don't give yourself entirely to the world, you won't enter the bodhisattva realm."

In the evening the master's wife visited. She always complained about the suffering she saw.
"What I want is an ordinary man and husband. I don't want a Buddha husband."
I understand her. For an ordinary woman to live with a man who became a saint must be great suffering.
Watching the master's work, I could understand the feelings of Socrates' wife Xanthippe too.
I had no other method than helping the master's wife understand the master's existence and quickly take refuge.

The first dharma meeting was held after opening Dalma-won. I briefly reported to people what I had done during the week.
Like a servant reporting to their master what they had done, I spoke of what I did, saw, and learned.

The master gave a teaching:
"You all have been trying to find facts for a long time while not knowing facts. But you couldn't clearly know how your destiny arose and how it proceeds. This morning on TV they were broadcasting a middle school quiz, and the host asked this question: The world even has wars because of this. What is it? The student answered politics. The answer was religion. Marx said religion is opium. If you know and believe in religion, it will be a great blessing for you, but if you believe without knowing, it's like opium and will eventually destroy you. Those addicted to opium look for places that will ruin them more and cling to them. But healthy people judge and work hard about their own matters, living difficult lives. People say they believe in Buddha but actually don't know what kind of being Buddha is. Buddha means teacher, namely an enlightened one, one who calls himself Tathagata and delivers blessings to humans. Why do blessings, disasters, diseases, and anguish that you see while living exist? Please ask about these things. If you truly ask, I'll give correct answers. Even if you shout prayers in ignorant places and give your heart to darkness, that may be abandoning yourself but cannot be saving yourself. When you realize you must bless yourselves, blessings will exist before you."

Question: What benefits does meditation have and what are its results?
Answer: Meditation is necessary for people living in modern society. It catches and stabilizes the wandering mind. Modern civilization has stolen work from people. The most difficult thing in the world is having no work. When material is abundant and there's extra time, people pursue wrong things and ruin themselves. Therefore those without work should meditate. Then at least they won't fall into wrong places and won't rot their spirit, helping maintain bodily health too. But better than meditation is finding work and working hard. If you plant and tend one pepper plant here, that effort is like meditation but the result is getting peppers. Find and do meaningful work for the world. Because that becomes your own merit.

Question: Is what's told at so-called fortune telling places these days superstition? Is it trustworthy?
Answer: The world's will is made of the law of cause and effect. You can make your destiny good or bad. The world may bless your destiny or not. From birth, people meet connections and those connections create destiny. But philosophy doesn't know the method to change those connections. Philosophy cannot change your destiny. When you learn this law of cause and effect and know the relationship between cause, environment, and result, you can become the master of destiny who creates and changes your own destiny. If you follow the words of those who don't know the law, you'll eventually ruin yourself.

Question: Monks say they serve Buddha, and shamans also say they serve Buddha. What are their merits and faults?
Answer: The world's blessings are obtained only through true life. Those who believe in Buddha should know the law of cause and effect and live according to that law. Those who serve Buddha should first have beautiful hearts. They must have good roots. When those without good roots say they serve Buddha, they're just selling Buddha.

The master conveyed facts clearly and plainly.

One day the master brought a monk named Wondo. His heart was covered by overflowing knowledge. He knew more about Buddha than the master, to the point where even the real Buddha couldn't match him.

When someone who's never been to Seoul and someone who has argue, sometimes the one who hasn't been wins. Saying he could never believe the master had reached the highest enlightenment, he made the absurd statement that a very high spirit must have possessed him.

"How can one possessed by spirits speak truth? Ghosts can never see truth. Spirits that possess people are ghosts. Those souls are ghosts. If that soul knew even one truth of life, it wouldn't become a wandering ghost. Heaven's celestial spirits are different from this world's spirits. They have extremely bright hearts and communicate with this world only through will. Spirits that descend on human bodies are ghosts and they are the most ignorant souls."

Wondo pleaded:
"Please don't say you're one who has attained complete enlightenment."
"I say so because it's fact. Those who hear, doubt, and leave will leave, those who stay will stay. Those who rejoice hearing this good news will live."

After he left, I told the master:
"I don't want you to show miracles to gather people. Isn't the best method guiding people to the human path, making them human, and saving them?"
"Your words are correct."

To those seeking the path:

The path is in the will, so gather that will and see the path. All paths exist in the world. Path to paradise. Path to hell. Path of blessing. Path of curse. Path of eternal life. Path of destruction. The enlightened one exists to guide those paths. Don't think of saints only as mysterious. If you illuminate what past saints came to the world to do and left, you can come closer to us. Otherwise you distance yourselves from us. Because the enlightened one always stands opposite simple expectations. The enlightened one's words are never beautiful or sweet. He only wants to teach right and wrong about facts you want to know and guide those who want to live more meaningful lives to the world of good results. People always don't illuminate facts as facts but illuminate the world with their own hearts. Therefore they're deceived by their own hearts. Objects appear different to one with 0.2 vision and one with 2.0 vision. The mind's eye is like this. In correct teaching the heart brightens. Those with bright hearts will know what they're doing and what results their actions will bring. Your future life changes according to how you understand your current life.

Someone asked at the dharma meeting:
"Where does the difference come from between those who live happily and unhappily in this world?"
The master answered:
"Difficult question. Happiness or unhappiness exists in one's own heart. If you know the future and work for yourself and the world, you'll live a life pursuing happiness. When confident that current efforts will bring good results, you can feel and see happiness in that. People always discover they were happy in past time. Happy life is bright life, life that sees results and works for those results. Happiness exists in the process of brightening the heart and working. Happiness is in life pursuing good and in life that brightens one's future through right work and obtains desired results."

A woman asked:
"Why was I born? Does each person have a purpose in being born?"
The master answered:
"Life is for living life. If you die because you don't want to live, you must be born again and live embracing that misery. Look at those plants. Everything is in that fruit, so when that fruit falls to the ground and sprouts, all of it appears again. That's resurrection. Everything you saw, heard, and felt while living accumulates to become your soul. One energy in your body is called life. It goes to the soul world again through will and returns to the life world through the fundamental world, meeting the world again in that will and blooming as oneself. Those who ask why they were born have extremely ignorant hearts. People are born through desire."

People ask what Dalma-won does. Without even one common Buddha statue, no wooden fish sound, not reading scriptures, not doing meditation, what do they do at that temple? We teach life. When you know and see, infinite blessings exist in the world. We obtain them only through our own lives. But people are too ignorant about life. They don't clearly know life's meaning, value, purpose, or direction. Being ignorant about life is the same as being ignorant about oneself. The greatest blessing obtained in the world is knowing oneself. The wisdom of knowing what you're doing is your highest enlightenment.

The Way exists in life and truth exists in facts. The Way is in the right heart. Living rightly is the human way. My mission is guiding people to the right path, because humans can save themselves only through truth. Religion without a saint's teaching is like opium. Religion that doesn't show facts through right and wrong is a trap. When the true one teaches truth, the learner can also obtain a true heart. A good heart is the key that eternally blesses one's future. A good heart comes from good spirit, and good spirit comes from good life. Through enlightenment you can discern right from wrong. By doing right things, when the heart becomes truthful and you know the world's affairs, you can see yourself.

Therefore Dalma-won is the house that gives enlightenment.

Destiny
Even if life lives just one day
It must be lived preciously.
Life is connected to
Endless future destiny.

We held dharma meetings twice a week. The number of people gathering was about 10 to 15.

The master's teaching was flowing water. If you entrust yourself to flowing water and flow together, you'll obtain eternal life's blessing, but if you entrust yourself to water that looks comfortable, you'll lose everything. He said to abandon your troubled heart and abandon the burden or worry of following flowing water.

I earnestly invited people to come to dharma meetings while visiting and calling them. But only about 10 people always gathered at meetings. Everyone was busy.

There's a similar story. Jesus had his disciples invite people to hold a teaching feast. Even then, everyone refused the invitation with the excuse of being busy.
So Jesus had his disciples say:
"Anyone walking by is fine. Just bring them unconditionally."
People are struggling chasing desires. I want to know how many people visit churches or temples seeking truth.

My work was difficult every day. I try to break people's vain expectations and make them see facts. I provided them no comfort at all. Truth isn't a comfort but a sharp knife that cuts out wounds. Those who seek truth are mature souls with courage to lie on the operating table themselves. Modern people's souls are like children. They like sweet and beautiful words. Hearts full of vanity chase vain expectations. Their souls are weak. So they want to be comforted. They suffer. So they want to be anesthetized. What's pure is strong. What's truthful is strong. I'm looking for good seeds.

I planned another trip to Japan. The master gave me topics to discuss. Mainly politics, education, religion, and medicine.

Before leaving for Japan, I first visited Korean mass media. If there was someone with bright eyes among Japan's leaders who recognized the master's wisdom, we might have to move our residence to Japan. It was my patriotism that prompted this.

Meeting the production director of the national TV station, I confessed the truth:
"This land now needs great wisdom. I know someone with the highest wisdom. I want to use his wisdom for this country. Please let this country's people know about his work. Raising one talented person will be more beneficial for this nation than helping ten thousand beggars."
I spoke earnestly and desperately but he wouldn't listen to my words at all. He cut me off:
"If you ask to meet me personally as Monk Soyeon, I'm willing to meet more, but for this matter I won't meet again."

I visited a major newspaper's advisor again. He said with a very cold attitude:
"If he's such an outstanding wisdom holder, first get recognition from foreign countries. Then journalists here will compete to cover the story."

He was someone who wouldn't lift a finger to investigate the truth of my words. Then again, is there anywhere in the world with as many masters as this land? They say eleven Gods, dozens of Second Coming Jesuses, countless Messiahs have been born. How can truth be revealed in this? But someday truth will be revealed, and it must be revealed for humanity, and I'll dedicate my life to this work.

April 24, 1989, I left for Tokyo Japan carrying the master's message. The master said he would provide the highest wisdom on 5 topics.

First, national peace and citizens' education. Second, saints' teachings and traps in religion. Third, human mental health and the highest medicine. Fourth, results through death obtained with life as cause. Fifth, humanity's transformation period and new humanity.

I met my niece Hyunsook at Narita Airport. Hyunsook was a senior at Fukuoka University and had Japanese skills so fluent that even Japanese people mistook her for Japanese.

I unpacked at a cheap inn and bought lunch boxes from a nearby supermarket to eat. From the next day, I visited various universities and media as planned.

I visited the president's offices of Tokyo University and Waseda University. I went around to the Tokyo University Hospital director, International Medical Exchange Association director, International Academic Exchange Human Science School, NHK TV station, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Fuji and other broadcasters and newspapers. But no one believed my words.

One editorial committee member at Mainichi said "The monk's words are too difficult to understand." The Yomiuri TV social information bureau chief asked me back as if annoyed:
"Monk, do you know what kind of place this is?"
I felt insulted but endured and told him:
"I came to give your country the best gift. What I have is the highest wisdom that can bless humans. Why do you work and why do you live? What's the ultimate goal?"

People have been reduced to parts in modern civilization's specialization and division of labor. Vision has become extremely narrow, and understanding the overall flow or essence of life has become more difficult.

The wise person is a treasure among humans. I went around carrying that treasure, begging them to please take it.

I made a proposal to an Asahi Newspaper editorial committee member:
"Among your national social problems, is there something you must get answers for but can't? If so, tell me. I'll give the best answer with the most outstanding wisdom."
After thinking for a while, he said he couldn't think of anything right now so he'd contact me by letter later.
I stopped by Yomiuri Newspaper and met a culture department reporter. After introducing the master to him, I proposed:
"Gather 200 Japanese geniuses in one place and have them face off with him. If they can just keep pouring out questions, he'll show amazing facts. But I doubt there's anyone among the Japanese with courage to push this forward."
Hearing my words, he was very bewildered:
"I'm interested that such a being exists. I'm willing to go cover the story in Korea. Since I need upper management's permission, please write his profile in detail."
I parted with the reporter, postponing the appointment.

For human vision to see even one principle requires decades of dedication to that one path. Enlightenment is just seeing all principles. One who sees appears in the world once in thousands of years, so it's perhaps natural that people don't recognize him. Therefore the master seeks truthful people. Only truthful hearts hear truth.

Hoping there might be someone in Japan who understands my words, I visited places daily without rest. I couldn't afford taxis and only took subways. Hyunsook's soles cracked after just one day and she had to walk with bandages. It was cold and hungry. We were turned away many times. When I called, they always first asked what the matter was. That was when it was hardest to speak. I couldn't lie, and when I told the truth, they wouldn't even open the door. Only my shabby appearance must have been reflected.

No one discovered the world's most shining treasure in my hands.
From the 6-day Japan trip, I returned empty-handed. Without meeting even one righteous person, rejected everywhere.

At Dalma-won, dharma meetings were held steadily twice a week, and noble teachings to save people and save the world unfolded.
But always only about 10 people gathered. The master always speaks the world's will but people's hearts have difficulty understanding that will.

The master lamented:
"People's hearts are dark and don't know cause and effect, so even when taught the law they don't understand. It can't be helped. Those who know and believe the law will live, otherwise they'll disappear. This too will happen according to the world's will."

One day in May we visited an elderly monk at a large temple on Jiri Mountain. He was 84 years old. The master told him to ask if there was anything he wanted to know.
Saying he knew nothing, he very earnestly asked one thing:
"When will peace settle in this country? Can't someone like you come forward and save the country?"
The master answered:
"Saving this country with my wisdom isn't that difficult. But how many people in this country would have me do that work? This country has no peace because this country's people don't truly want peace. All worldly matters are in the will, and through that will blooming and withering, there are all kinds of rise and fall."
The elderly monk saw us off to the gate, grasped the master's hand and pleaded for him to save the country.

A woman attended the Dalma-won dharma meeting. Returning home after the meeting, she said to her companion:
"Why believe that person instead of believing me?"

The master heard this and laughed heartily:
"Those words are right. You don't come here for me. You come here for discovering your own truth, for your own enlightenment.
Pay a bit more attention. Why is that person called a completely enlightened one? What's different from ordinary life? That woman simply denied without knowing anything.
Remember. It's fact that even things not known while alive will be clearly seen after death. After death everything can be known. But in the world of death nothing can be achieved or changed.
The day that woman closes her eyes, she'll know who I am and how precious my words were."

A woman complained of her misfortune:
"I'm too unfortunate. Even my husband says living with me is lifelong suffering because of me. I'd rather divorce for my husband and child."
The master said:
"It's not that you lack fortune but that you're not seeking fortune. All matters are in the will, so find and create that will. I'll teach you that will, and if you follow accordingly, your destiny will change and your family will become happy. Your soul can also bear fruit and become a teacher of the world."
The master gave her the highest blessing.

After that she never appeared before us again. Those who don't make effort to realize and create will cannot be helped even by Buddha.
That woman will carry her karma all her life, her family will break down, suffer in old age, obtain nothing from the world and return.

People ran away when blessed. But if we lied, we would ruin ourselves.

How do you want to live? According to your decision, life's result is already determined. There's only one person in this world who can tell you life's results.

People don't like hearing facts. They close their eyes to facts and follow their thoughts. The world is different from thoughts. The world is the world and thoughts are thoughts. People realize past facts only after being hit, like children. Regret is useless. All results are created by oneself and received by oneself. This is truth. Just learning the law isn't without realization, but when there's effort to hear and practice, realization comes quickly.

Someone said:
"I practice Taoism."
"What's the purpose?"
"Immortality."
"No need to struggle not to age and live long. You can live eternally too. Obtain the soul's freedom. You obtain freedom to choose when and where you want to be born, freedom to choose destiny. Death is like taking off old clothes, birth is like putting on new clothes. By being born, dying, and being born again, you live eternally. You're eternally on life's path."

An elderly person asked:
"I've been ill all my life. Is there a way for people to escape illness?"
The master answered:
"There are three main cases of getting ill. First, having illness's cause in the foundation brought from past lives, second, meeting bad environment in the world. Third, obtaining it in daily life. If the foundation brought from past lives is strong, you can defeat illness. When current life is heavier karma than your foundation, it harms your health. When your soul's energy is bright, you can defeat dark energy. To live without illness, you must obtain enlightenment above all. The enlightened can avoid illness. The enlightened can avoid all disasters."

Someone asked:
"People living in modern society have hearts becoming poor in inverse proportion to material abundance. What's the path to enriching the heart?"
The master said:
"Hearts are poor because of people's ignorance. To see the heart's abundance, you must farm the heart. Like farmers farming and seeing abundant harvest, you must see the heart's abundance that way. How to obtain the best heart? The answer is this: 'Serve the world.'"

I introduced an Indian named Rajneesh to the master. Some called him the 20th century Buddha or an enlightened one. I shared a few of his many words with the master. Among his words was this:
"Truth can only be known by the truthful. It requires tremendous effort."
The master said:
"If these are Rajneesh's words, he too is enlightened. But there's a high possibility he read it somewhere and said it. There's one clear fact. If I met him and questioned him, he'd have difficulty answering even one out of ten. If he asked me ten things, I'd give over 95% accurate answers. Let's leave for India in October."

We planned a trip to India. For people waiting for us somewhere, to meet those truly seeking Buddha's path and teach them that path.

Speaking truth to those with sleeping souls is difficult. Seeking truth in a pitch-dark world is also difficult. Reality laid before one with eyes is simple and clear, but the blind who cannot see cannot understand and accept that simple and clear fact. Truth isn't expressed through the word truth. Truth is seen as evidence existing in facts.

Anyone can easily say truth, but becoming truthful is extremely difficult. If you hear an enlightened one's words, believe and practice them, you'll definitely see results. People didn't practice because they didn't believe his truth. It was a difference of heart. Rather, his words rubbed people the wrong way. Because they provided no comfort.

Someone challengingly asked:
"Then will you save us?"
"No. Save yourself through yourself. I only point out the path of salvation. You make the effort. If you lack courage, I'll lend courage, if you lack heart, I'll lend heart. But if you have no heart to save yourself, I can neither lend nor help anything."

The master lived in the world's loneliest place. Family, relatives, neighbors, friends were all too far from him, and between people there was an insurmountably high wall.

Wall
In human hearts
Heaven and earth's will blooms
That beautiful light
Was truly fearful and sorrowful.
Seeing what happened in thousands of years
I called others out of love
But the heart's wall is high and high.

The master was so happy and delighted he didn't know what to do whenever he saw people. Because he thought these would become masters of the new world, the new world would bloom from them, and they would lead future humanity. When they complained of misfortune, he blessed with all his heart and tried to convey all wisdom, but the more the master approached people, the more they feared, doubted, and ran away. Without expecting any compensation, he desperately wanted to give all the good things he had.

The master said:
"Everyone, if you like your current self, keep yourself. If you're anxious about yourself, take the non-anxious I (Tathagata). Having a master is obtaining a new self. I only teach the path, I don't change others' destinies. Destiny arises from the interaction of one's foundation, basis, and environment. Therefore unless you change yourself, destiny is determined. You seek one who has reached the highest because your destiny hasn't reached the highest, and you want to obtain his destiny. When you awaken to truth and want to know truth, the bad destiny blocking your way disappears and new destiny blooms wide."

Enlightenment changes destiny.

A woman complained:
"My mother serves ghosts. If she dies without enlightenment, what's her posthumous destiny? And will that ghost affect even her children?"
"Even if parents served ghosts, if you firmly cut it off, it won't connect to the children's generation. In any situation, when my heart is bright, ghosts cannot enter me. People who die serving ghosts will have the same destiny as those ghosts again. Because they know no other path. When humans stay long in any environment, it sticks to the heart. Wisdom is needed to cut off ghosts. Those serving ghosts look strong externally but are mentally very weak, so they can't cut it off."
"What's the method to save my mother?"
"She must first realize. Through dialogue you can sufficiently make her realize. If she has fear of ghosts, in special cases I can directly help. But I'm now reluctant to help people with ability rather than wisdom. Before fixing the heart, I fixed the body, so only lust grew bigger and they just chased vain things. When misfortune's cause is in the world, I can help with my ability. But when misfortune's cause is in oneself, and when one doesn't want to let it go, I cannot help that."

Right now in this world, there are countless people possessed by spirits. My hometown was a small southern island. When I was young, I saw many women in our neighborhood possessed by spirits. It was one house every three or four houses. One of my cousins also received over ten spirits.
Through the ghost's mouth she said:
"In the end times, spirits will attach to every blade of grass."

That's how much ghosts will proliferate. In the past, if you said ghosts exist, you were called ignorant. These days if you claim ghosts don't exist, you're called ignorant. This ghost problem is a serious issue directly related to humanity's destruction, so it will be discussed more carefully later.

One day I met a professor majoring in botany. He was strongly arguing that the earth lives only when the land revives. He introduced himself as having been in the choir since childhood and still a Christian even with white hair.
"Professor, what do you really want to know through life?"
I looked at him smiling.
"Monk, does the soul exist?"
That was his question.

A young pastor evaluated as capable came to see me. He had almost the best connections for succeeding as a pastor. But his youth was greatly anguished about his work. We talked for 9 hours without rest.
He asked with great difficulty:
"Does God exist?"

I met an elder. He had been a devout believer for over 40 years.
"Monk, they say when that day comes, even skeletons lying in graves will rise among the saved. That's what's written in the Bible. We have nothing to believe but the Bible."
He didn't believe it.

I met a pastor who had been a military chaplain for over 25 years. When the discussion became difficult, he tried to suppress with canned phrases:
"Christianity is on a different level from other religions. It can't be compared. How you lived doesn't matter much. It's a religion where you're saved by accepting Jesus."
"Pastor, would you recognize Jesus if you met him?"
"How would I recognize him? We don't know in what form he'll appear among us."

The discussion ended. How will they recognize him?
Who will accept Jesus whom they can't recognize? People have no right answers about their most important problems. When they don't know what they truly need to know, life is anxious, the future is opaque, and anguish, delusion, wandering, and suffering don't cease.

In the world, those who say they'll attain enlightenment or seek truth are many in rumors but actually meeting them is like picking stars from the sky. If places of practice become places of escape, you can receive comfort there. But before those who don't know the path, there's only frustration. People don't believe truth but believe their foolish thoughts and chase them like truth. They regarded their ignorance as truth.

Neither truth nor fact can exist in ignorance. Right words cannot exist where there are no facts, and facts cannot be conveyed where there are no right words. If you think you can deceive the world by selling gods, selling Buddha, selling Jesus, that's nonsense. That matter has nothing to do with dead saints. It will all appear in themselves, becoming sin karma, meeting illness, troubles, and all disasters, thereby creating an unfortunate afterlife path. People compete to do wrong things but few seek their true selves. This is one of the most regrettable things seen in this era.

Those who sell saints to help their desires will never reach heaven.

House of Illusion
There's no master
But the master's name exists.
There's no Way
But sound exists.
Building a house of illusion
And inviting the blind
In stagnant water
Disaster hides.

Someone asked:
"Please explain the teaching that an enlightened one's words are like flowing water and a fool's words are like stagnant water."
"Flowing water doesn't rot and stagnant water rots. Those who follow an enlightened one's teaching obtain eternal life. Flowing water will eventually enter the sea, and the sea lives forever. It's the sea of eternal life. Stagnant water eventually rots, so those following fools will abandon themselves. Flowing water is tiresome. Stagnant water looks peaceful externally. It's stable. But inside it's full of stench and ugliness. Following an enlightened one is hard. Those who follow want to rest. But flowing water doesn't let them rest.
The reason people don't come to me and don't come to Dalma-won is because I'm enlightened. When they come here, they gain healthy spirit. Flowing water washes away their illusions. They come to see their own appearance correctly. That's sometimes miserable, ugly, and painful. So they run far from here. Actually they're running from themselves. If they overcome the temptation to run and continue contacting truth, that's the greatest blessing. They obtain life's standard.
My teaching sees and conveys facts as they are, so if you take my words and illuminate the world, you'll soon know it."

People I met used words like heresy or cult while criticizing me. I asked them: What is the right way and what is cult? What's the standard that defines right way and cult? I haven't seen anyone who knows that properly and clearly.

When day broke, the master had to go out looking for people again. Once outside, there was nowhere to go. He just rode buses, got off at train stations, and took trains wherever his heart led. That day too he went out without direction and visited a large temple in Gyeongbuk to meet the elderly head monk.

The master asked:
"Why don't you seek the Buddha dharma?"
Strangely, whenever Buddha dharma came up, monks regardless of rank closed their mouths.
The master explained the differences between Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures:
"After attaining enlightenment, I occasionally heard contents from Buddhist scriptures through others' mouths. Each time I was very puzzled. Why did Buddha speak so ambiguously? I couldn't understand the reason well. Then recently I learned the truth. I was shocked hearing Buddha's teachings in the Hinayana scriptures through Soyeon. That was clearly what Buddha said. The Hinayana scriptures preserved Buddha's words well. The Mahayana scriptures went through scholars' hands. Truth is a formula. Changing even one letter changes the meaning. If you change 9+3 to 9-3, the answer comes out nonsensically. I clearly say that practicing through Hinayana scriptures, you can see Buddha's heart, but through Mahayana scriptures you cannot know that path. Through Hinayana scriptures you at least won't ruin yourself."
The master taught about practice for over two hours. That monk was elderly so listening seemed difficult too.
"I must go now. Finally, if there's something you really want to know, ask. I'll answer."
He asked without rhyme or reason:
"I don't want to know anything. Just one thing - what will happen to this country?"
"To get an accurate answer, you must accurately know this country's problems. Speaking answers when problems aren't clear is very dangerous. If you want to hear my view, I'll speak. This country is drifting now. Think of a ship drifting at sea. If we don't fundamentally fix the current existing appearance, this country's future is very anxious."
He asked:
"Then can't the country be saved? Why are you trying to go abroad? Shouldn't you save this country first?"
The master was frustrated:
"When changing my own heart is difficult, how can I change the world's people's hearts? Heaven's will is in people and people's will appears in the world through heaven, so how can this not be heaven's will and the world's will? But nothing is impossible to solve in the human world. There's no path but informing people of facts through education and treating the source."
The elderly head monk said:
"Even a room dark for a thousand years, when one lamp is lit, that darkness disappears."
"Those words make sense. But we don't know how bright that lamp is or how wide that space is. One lamp cannot brighten this whole country."
He was silent.
"I've told you clearly. I've reached the highest level as a human body, and if I meet someone in this world who surpasses my wisdom, I'll immediately stop transmitting the dharma. How is someone like me living now? I've prepared a small house of enlightenment called Dalma-won and am awakening people there. By telling factual stories twice a week, I awaken their sleeping hearts. But those who come to hear my words don't even fill that small room. In fact, even my wife and children don't follow that path because they don't know my teaching is good. Saving one human heart isn't as easy as it sounds. If people have no interest in themselves and don't help themselves, what use is an enlightened one's wisdom or ability? It's karma and self-inflicted, so unless those with bad causes fix those causes, they cannot obtain peace."
The master urged him:
"Do you have courage to learn and transmit the dharma?"
"I'm too old and my body hurts."
The master looked at his body. It was a chronic illness he got when he was one year old.

When you go abroad, southern monks often discuss Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. Speaking from common sense, Hinayana Buddhism prioritizes self-cultivation and Mahayana Buddhism prioritizes saving sentient beings. That is to say, those who can see the world's path should go the Mahayana path and those who can't see the world's path should go the Hinayana path. When you can't even see your own future path, how can you help others' future paths? Don't believe those in the world now who rashly claim to help others. Most are just blind or hypocrites. The more false philanthropists and false patriots there are, the more that world will perish. A world where falsehood defeats truth can only roll backwards.

Many people have been interested in Maitreya Buddha and rumors say many Maitreyas are being born in this country these days. They say they've also created the world's largest Maitreya Buddha statue.

People coming to Dalma-won wanted to know about Maitreya. The master taught:
"Buddha comes from among people. He's a person who obtained truth and reached enlightenment. Obtaining the world is difficult. Obtaining the heart is equally difficult. To obtain the true heart requires tremendous cultivation and effort. Conscience and courage don't fill the heart overnight.
Speaking about Maitreya Buddha is somewhat difficult. Because it might give you false thoughts, doubt, or disappointment.
Maitreya Buddha is the world's most truthful being. While he's alive, people won't know who he is. But later the world will know he came and went. Through what will they know? His teaching. They'll realize only his teaching was the highest blessing. Because only through his teaching can one not create ghosts while alive and obtain the path of eternal life and paradise.
If you hear talk of Maitreya or Maitreya era elsewhere, never be deceived. Through this autumn's journey, when I meet the people I must meet, I'll tell them facts about the world's destruction and the world after destruction."

An individual's heart brightening or darkening depends on that person's actions. The world being bright or dark depends on the hearts of people living in that world. Those who know facts can care for themselves, those who don't know facts have no way to care for themselves.

The master visited various places that day too to convey facts to people and awaken them.
He visited a women's center. When he told staff he came for consultation, without offering a chair they asked what the matter was.
The master said:
"I'm someone researching natural science. I want to teach life wisdom to women coming here."
"Specifically what wisdom?"
"Truth of goodness for recovering humanity, or about modern people's stress and illness."
He brushed off the master with the excuse that the person in charge wasn't there. In this land, getting opportunities to speak truth was tremendously difficult.
When he visited an elderly college somewhere and expressed his intentions to staff, they showed reluctance saying the operations manager wasn't there so come next Friday. Even free lectures were refused.
The next day when he called the women's center again, the director made excuses in an embarrassed tone that as a public organization she had no decision-making authority.
He visited the YMCA center again and met the general affairs manager:
"With content more knowledgeable than any professor or scholar you request, I want to give you meaning and obtain meaning myself."
"Since lecturers are scheduled from the beginning of the year here, I have no authority to invite special personnel."
The world was so thoroughly organized there was no gap for those who know facts to step in.

The next day the master visited the elderly college again. After waiting over an hour, he finally met the principal. The master told the principal:
"I have outstanding intuition. I can take people's questions and give appropriate responses from a high perspective."
Finally the principal guided the master before about 100 elderly people. One hour of lecture was permitted.
The master first told the elderly an interesting anecdote he had heard:
"A retired professor from Nepal visited an Indian master named Rajneesh who had worldwide fame.
He asked Rajneesh: 'What is the meaning of life?'
Rajneesh simply answered: 'Life has no meaning.'
The old professor pleaded: 'I came a long way to hear the answer. Please don't send me back empty-handed.'
Rajneesh answered: 'The purpose of life is returning empty-handed.'"
The master asked the elderly again:
"What is the meaning of life? Does life really have no meaning at all?"
No one answered.
The master recalled that the elderly had gone to the countryside two days ago to cut barley.
"Is that barley you cut dead?"
Someone answered:
"The barley is alive."
"Right. That barley's roots, stems, and leaves died but the barley contained all its past and future in its fruit. All memories of its entire life are contained in that fruit. When it obtains foundation (earth) and environment again and blooms, it lives again exactly as itself. Good and bad things in your daily work accumulate exactly to create your fruit (soul). Through that you see your own appearance again. If you want to create beautiful memories through your life and obtain a blessed future, you must learn facts above all. If there are facts you want to know, ask."
Someone said:
"We know nothing so have nothing to ask."
"You're elderly who have seen much of the world, yet you know nothing and are curious about nothing?"
The master had to ask again:
"How would you distinguish between devils and angels?"
"Angels have beautiful hearts, devils have ugly hearts."
"Those words are right too. But can you actually recognize beautiful hearts and ugly hearts?"
They said they couldn't know. The master told them about his enlightenment and Dalma-won:
"Humans are enchanted by beautiful sounds and fear threats, so they're always dragged by devils. Devils rule people with beautiful sounds and threatening fear. Humans can see facts only through conscience and courage. Illuminate your right and wrong with facts in reality. And correct your wrongness. How many people can realize this seemingly ordinary teaching is the greatest blessing given to people on Buddha's path?"
When the master finished lecturing, the elderly clapped and were happy, and asked him to write down contact information.
But the elderly college principal's attitude was hostile. He began reproaching the master:
"You seem arrogant."
"I've never once thought my attitude was arrogant. I just spoke facts."
"How many facts do you know?"
He looked very displeased.
"Well, I know as much as I know. If Principal has something curious, ask me too."
The master became upset. If not doing this work of loving the world, this was someone who couldn't even sit face to face. They say the master's spirit before enlightenment was truly tremendous.
Now trying to find true people only for the world and serve them as masters, he had to be polite before everyone.
That principal had been a pastor for 7 years. He asked:
"What's your view on whether Virgin Mary was a virgin or not?"
"I don't know such facts. I wasn't present when Mary conceived Jesus. And I have no interest in whether Jesus was born from a virgin or not. I see Jesus as a very important figure. Because he acted very differently from ordinary people. Seeing people of that era living wrongly, he tried to awaken their truth and offered his innocent body as sacrifice on the cross. That was a great lesson for future generations."
The principal argued about various Jesus issues. The master asked him in frustration:
"Did you see those facts?"
"Of course I didn't see them."
He answered.
"Look. There's no need to argue about facts neither you nor I have seen. We should discern good and bad with evidence existing in facts, not argue about what in the absence of facts."
He became quiet.
"What I told people coming here today is that all phenomena in this world are made of will. Therefore if I know the facts of what I want to do, through those facts I obtain the results I want to obtain. You don't see the truth in a truthful person's words so you call that truth itself arrogance, but many contradictions exist in the world. Truth is just truth. Arrogance is in looking down on others, how can there be arrogance in one who values others? I didn't come here to demand anything from you, so why would I have arrogance?"

People in the world often curse as arrogant, are jealous and envious when someone doesn't suit their heart and looks superior to them.

Those who see truth in this era will become lonelier. But when overcoming that loneliness and accomplishing difficult work, they'll obtain desired results in the desired world. Obtaining good things requires even more sweat and sincerity.

Humans are lonely. Therefore they expect beautiful things, comfort. Humans are weak. They fear threats. Now in the world there are many places that bind people with beautiful words and fearful threats under the name of religion. Everything depends on one's own heart. If I don't do fearful things, fear doesn't exist.

Ancient sages prophesied. In the end times there will be no one who knows truth and very few who have truth. Don't believe people's truth. Truth is fact. Truth cannot exist where facts aren't spoken, and who will see truth where there's no truth?

People deceive and are deceived daily. They don't even think they're deceiving others. Because they don't even know the fact that they're deceiving even when deceiving. Because they can't see facts, they can't help but be deceived and deceive. This is precisely why Dalma-won exists. The hope is to ask about problems in life, realize through that, and therefore always care for oneself with dignified and comfortable life.

Buddha's path will continue eternally without ceasing in the world. When the dharma is ruined like now, one with special connection comes from heaven and establishes the dharma again. People don't know this at that time. When it blooms and those seeds bloom again, they know it's truly good. People will repeat the foolish act of offering all praise and worship and calling out that name only after the master has gone.

No matter how much we invited, people didn't come to Dalma-won. There are two reasons.

One is that we didn't lie, and one is that we don't frighten. The teaching here is incomparable to anywhere. Even if everyone cuts off their visits and we must leave this land, we absolutely cannot hold people's hearts with lies.

Someone asked:
"How should we think about fortune telling by birth date and time?"

"If you lack nothing currently and want nothing more, you may live as your heart desires. But if you have defects and desires, quickly obtain enlightenment.

Fortune telling comes from past life matters. I must speak life's meaning again. Life creates memories. Memories accumulate and ripen into one fruit. When that fruit falls to the ground, rots, and sprouts again, the memories inside bloom again. Resurrection. That fundamental power from past lives blooms exactly. That meets foundation and environment again, opening new memories. In fortune telling, there exist temperament, character, and nature. Temperament comes from past life's foundation, character is greatly influenced by basis, and nature is power arising when environment collides. Fortune telling appears from here. Fortune isn't decisive. If you deny yourself, there's no fortune. If you can't abandon your past, you must live according to fortune.

If you have great desire, fortune changes. If you're attached to the past and have no desire, you can only go the determined path. I don't tell you to believe in fortune. The enlightened have no fortune. If you hear the dharma and obtain enlightenment, even if born with bad fortune, it disappears. Destiny is starting again. Even if you enjoy good fortune now just from merit created in past lives, if you live without enlightenment, that merit will gradually decrease."

"Christianity speaks of faith, hope, and love. Was this Jesus's teaching?"

"Those words are beautiful. But there's no connection of meaning. Faith - what do people now believe in? What can people who can't know any facts properly believe?

Jesus. He was an extraordinary figure. He tried to awaken humans' true hearts. He bore the cross of suffering. The cross proves the result of goodness that giving one's life for justice is never wrong. It's a mark of power where love and courage truly connect. Christians who believe Jesus was crucified and died for the world gain great courage.

Most people with religion request salvation from unknowable gods. Salvation must arise within oneself, and god is just a witness. Pray to god. Pray for help so your righteousness doesn't collapse due to darkness. You cannot deceive god.

God is smarter than people. Not deceived by people. God is fair and just. Think who will save you in this world. God will help those who help themselves. Don't blindly praise his name but praise that will. God is in heaven. If you respect him, go beside him and respect. But without going through truthful life, going beside him is impossible. The weak and foolish try to obtain themselves through god. The strong and wise try to see god through themselves.

Face the world with courage. Overcome fear with courage and overcome shame with courage. There are things in this world you must definitely fear. They are these two points: Am I not deceiving others? Am I not harming others? Whatever you do wherever, if it's for your right life, it's joyful."

"What's the path to escape anguish?"

"Before enlightenment I was in the same place as you. But now there's no anguish. The answer to that question is both easy and difficult. Only when all lust in my chest has burned away does anguish disappear too. Anguish comes to the enlightened too. But it doesn't accumulate. Unless you abandon lust and attachment in your hearts, you can't escape anguish. For humans to escape life of anguish is very difficult. By living factual life, not being deceived by the world and not deceiving the world, you finally arrive there."

Mirage
Louder than Jewish cries
Stronger than Germanic anger.
You who dance after creating bad karma.
Do you know the mirage's secret?

Someone wanted explanation of this poem. The master said:

"This poem was written seeing ignorance existing in this land. Today this land's reality is chasing mirages. As time passes, you'll see thirst and exhaustion. What of the Jews killed Jesus? Because of their ignorance. Because of ignorance they couldn't see facts at all. Because Jesus broke their expectations, they hated and killed him.

When I meet people too, the most troubling problem is whether to rescue them from ignorance or leave them fallen in ignorance. The best path to save oneself is the path of escaping from one's ignorance. Salvation begins from breaking all your wrong expectations.

Since the blind can't see anything, they live relying on just one expectation, but if you mercilessly break that, they run away first without trying to recognize facts. Seeing these things, I learned how difficult it is to save even one sentient being.

Jesus broke ignorant Jews' idols and shattered their expectations. Since they couldn't understand Jesus, they couldn't forgive him either. Jesus said you go to heaven only through facts. Facts are cold. The world drawn with eyes closed can be made as beautiful as you want, but when you open your eyes, only stark reality exists before you.

What did they gain by killing Jesus? They gained one more ignorance. For the ignorant, living in the world is very difficult. Because they can't see the path, they fight just meeting people. Their nation collapsed and they became people without a country scattered in the world. And for 1,800 years it's fact they received the harshest treatment living among people. Why? Because they had no master to enlighten them, they had difficulty changing their destiny. They also believed God would save them and committed greater sins through that. They're people who abandoned truth of goodness and chose God's name.

How about this land today? When this land's people don't obtain a master to enlighten their ignorance and turn away from facts not knowing what they're doing, what will become of this nation and society's future? You'll see grief more terrible than Jewish cries and greater than the sorrow they suffered. This is from truth's perspective.

Now stop chasing mirages. Stop expecting what doesn't exist. Now return to facts and see what relationship your work has for society and yourself. This poem means we can escape unfortunate destiny when people walk the right path for themselves and society."

Living in the world, there's something you must never obtain - that's han (resentment). Calling the Korean people a people of han and Korean culture han culture is actually terrible. There are two important teachings you mustn't forget to not obtain han in the world.

First, don't expect about things you don't know.
Second, don't expect results for things you haven't done.

Many good people have come and gone from this world, and good people came before this world too. Of course good people will come to the next world too. They taught Buddha's path and through that teaching the human world has continued endlessly. Buddha is someone who completed their own truth and with that truth sees the world's will and teaches humans the most blessed path.

Buddha doesn't come to fill unknowable expectations in human hearts but breaks vain expectations in human hearts. Therefore they teach to see the cold world correctly and achieve your desires and bless your future only through your own will and effort.

In living in the world, don't believe what I don't know. These days many fools are flocking to places that claim to see past lives. From what I've learned, even seeing one's own past life is only possible after entering the stage of spiritual penetration, and this stage is a very high spiritual state.

The current act of seeing others' past lives is either illusion's effect or completely ignorant people's doing. We feel sorry because we always break people's expectations. But whether good or bad, knowing facts quickly is the best medicine. Believing lies and practicing them only wastes life.

At Dalma-won, people gathered to discuss each other's lives, discuss views, and obtain the best answers through the enlightened master's eyes.

The dharma meeting's purpose was the problem of how to live, knowing what among facts one has experienced is right and benefiting one's life.

People think the enlightened one sits and knows everything. No. Buddha knows nothing. Because he knows nothing, he can see facts. The world is correctly reflected in that heart that knows nothing.

The master earnestly urged people:

"Don't have expectations about things you don't know. If you have expectations about things you don't know, you're easily deceived. You must first know what kind of work you're doing."

Of course I'm not saying don't have any expectations unconditionally. Humans must have hope. A world without hope is hard to live in. But when expecting on a factual foundation, you're not deceived. People create han because of unfulfilled expectations.

Nothing miraculous happens immediately when people meet an enlightened one. Facts give clear standards. What standards? Standards for seeing and judging the world. These standards make life clear. Standards prevent wasting life.

Even beings who've reached complete enlightenment know nothing before seeing facts. If there's no object in front, what can a mirror reflect? Everything is known only by seeing. The enlightened see facts and convey facts.

There are records that Shakyamuni Buddha also reached complete enlightenment but wandered all over India his whole life looking for people to transmit that dharma to. It wasn't that there were no people beside him but that there were no people to learn the dharma.

After knowing the path that most blesses humans, the master also wandered all over this country wanting to bless people. But without finding people, he fights with time daily.

There's no work as painful as playing, no life as tiresome.
Since the master wants nothing from the world, there's no life as tiresome as life without expectations.

Not meeting people who want to bless themselves, there's nowhere to give his blessing.
