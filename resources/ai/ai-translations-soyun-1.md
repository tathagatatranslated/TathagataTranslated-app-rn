# Publisher's Note

I, an English speaker, asked some AI software to translate this into English.

I made multiple translations and they came out materially differently each time.

The prompt I used for the following translation asked the translator to tell the truth, not make up anything, and to translate directly, but to make a translation which actually can be understood in English (since some phrases do not intelligibly translate when truly literal.)

But sometimes AI makes stuff up, and I am unable to verify or vouch for this translation, so beware of taking it as canonical or authoritative or even true to the original content.

It would be a great and worthwhile goal for someone who speaks Korean natively to carefully check this translation and to please suggest to this publisher any corrections they might like to see made.

Original Korean source material follows English translation.

**Yoon So-yeon**

**Renunciation**

Why am I living?
What is my origin?
Where did I come from and where am I heading?
What will be the result of this life?
Is death truly the end of life?
If so, why must I live this arduous life?

I wrestled painfully with the world's unsolvable problems and finally resolved to enter the path of spiritual seeking.

To clarify life's truth for myself, I prepared to abandon everything I had gained in the world and leave alone for the mountains.

Late November 1981. I was thirty years old.

The biggest problem in leaving was, of course, my mother. As an only daughter without brothers, I was living with my widowed mother who was over seventy, so abandoning my mother was extremely difficult.

When I asked my cousin and his wife, with whom I'd been on good terms, to care for my mother's old age, they didn't refuse.

After settling my mother's living arrangements, I submitted my resignation at work. I was a middle school English teacher in my eighth year of teaching.

Now only the departure remained. I looked back on the journey of my life that had brought me to this point.

====================

My mother had no children until she was over forty. She gave birth to four children, but they all died before reaching three or four years old. The fourth child's body was buried in the middle of the village crossroads.

It was a terrible thing my mother did after hearing it would extend the next child's life.

Eventually, unable to walk on that path, my mother left her home island and moved to neighboring Yokji Island.

She was now living like strangers with her husband. When she passed forty, my mother became even lonelier and worried about her old age. So she prayed with utmost devotion for one hundred days to the gods of heaven and earth to grant her a son.

Perhaps her devotion moved heaven, for one day her husband, with whom she'd been living like strangers, came to visit, and the next day he left again.

Nine months later, a baby was barely born on the verge of death.
The dried, twisted umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby's body nine times, and the baby couldn't cry with its throat constricted.

It was a daughter. My mother said in disappointment:
"Kill it."

She actually didn't breastfeed the baby and pushed her under the wardrobe for three days, waiting for that life to die.

My mother, who had given birth to a daughter instead of a son, feared the mother-daughter fate would become unhappy.

The niece who was nursing my mother secretly obtained milk from others and fed the baby behind her aunt's back.

When the baby didn't die after three days, my mother saw it was fate to raise the child, and once she resolved, she devoted her entire life to raising her with utmost devotion.

From age eleven, I left my mother's side to study on the mainland, learning the pain of loneliness and yearning. I entered middle school at the top of my class and won first place in the Gyeongsangnam-do English competition, making my mother proud.

When I turned seventeen, I went to find my father and asserted my rights. His young wife threw a fit. That day I saw what I shouldn't have seen - my father's cowardice. Much later I understood his position, but at that time it was unacceptable.

Rejected by my father, I stood on Busan's Yeongdo Bridge to die but was too scared to jump.

I promised never to appear before them again, and after that I never met my father again.

However, hatred toward him was slowly growing in my heart. From then on, I turned more decisively toward life's suffering.

In my first year of high school, I had a beloved friend for the first time. I had to see my friend Cheol-suk even on Sundays. One day she showed me a letter. In that letter were these words:

"The bird breaks out of the egg. The bird flies to god. The god's name is Abraxas. God of good and evil."

Something like that? They were words from Hermann Hesse's Demian, though I didn't know it at the time. It was a letter from her brother, and from then on I admired that man because of its content.

That summer I saw him once for the first time, and that winter he got married.

I got through three years of high school well, relying on my friend. Due to family circumstances, I went to teachers' college. Cheol-suk went to Dong-A University's Korean literature department. I disliked the teachers' college curriculum. I didn't want to play the organ either. I always barely fulfilled two-thirds of the attendance requirement and barely passed exams.

Cheol-suk got a boyfriend. The man pursued her passionately and finally achieved his goal. Nineteen-year-old Cheol-suk cried so much at the wedding that her eyelashes fell out. I came home and cried terribly, burying myself under the blanket.

Before I even graduated, my mother finally fell ill. She sustained herself with sleeping pills and painkillers. It was severe insomnia and headaches.

After graduation, I stood at an elementary school podium. But teaching young children didn't suit my temperament.

When I turned twenty-four, I decided to become a professor and transferred to Dong-A University's English literature department. Of course, it was night school.

In the busy routine of teaching and studying from 5 AM to midnight, I felt a sense of fulfillment that seemed like really living.

English literature was interesting enough, and I earned the highest scores combining day and night divisions while acquiring three years' worth of credits in two years.

My colleagues nicknamed me "the scary woman."

I was an honor student who didn't fall behind among people.

Good at work, good at studying, good at dancing, good at singing, tall, good-looking - my exterior was extremely vivacious.

But my interior was endlessly complicated. When I passed twenty-five, my mother pressured me. My marriage was my mother's supreme task. But I had no courage to enter a wedding hall, and it was difficult to muster the courage to crush my mother's hopes.

At twenty-six, I had my first arranged meeting.

The man, a Seoul National University graduate from a yangban family in Andong with a good job, proposed to me on our third meeting. I postponed my answer and met him a few more times.

He desperately needed a woman and was anxious to have the wedding as soon as possible.

It became an implicit acceptance, and his parents sent a wedding date.

He called. "The wedding date has been sent. Let's meet."

The moment I heard that, my heart sank. No marriage. My soul rejected it.

He was waiting for me full of joy. Before he could say anything, I interrupted him first.

"No. Don't say it. I'm sorry, but I can't marry."

He was stunned.

"What's the reason?"

"I don't know the reason either. I just think I shouldn't marry. I'm truly sorry."

After many words were exchanged, he finally got angry and cursed me.

"No one will love a woman like you!"

Leaving his curse behind, I left the coffee shop first.

Always being in life yet unable to understand life was frustrating. Was I afraid of entering another person's life again while carrying the burden of unsolved questions?

One spring night, I had an unforgettable dream. Hundreds of people were sitting or lying, swarming in front of a huge gate. When I looked inside the gate, it was a very beautiful place.

"What is that place?" I asked.
"It's paradise."
"Then why doesn't anyone go in there? Mother, please wait here a moment. I'll go in briefly and come back."

It was extremely peaceful there. I walked alone along a small path. Then suddenly the path ended and an endless blue sea spread out. Since the path was cut off, I planned to continue by climbing the cliff beside it. When I stepped on the cliff, in front of me was a Buddhist nun sitting in lotus position facing the sea in a round hollow.

"You belong to this place, so why have you come only now?"

I couldn't answer her question.

"You have great sorrow on your face."

"Yes, my mother is seventy and I am twenty-eight."

"What kind of person are you looking for?"

"Someone true and good..."

"Would such a person exist in today's world? Drink this water and go."

I received the water she gave me, drank it, and came out.

The next morning I went to Beomeosa Temple on Geumjeong Mountain.

I slowly walked up and approached the Buddha statue in the main hall.

For the first time since becoming aware, I knelt before the Buddha statue.

"Buddha, I have now returned."

Hot tears welled up. Unable to stop the wailing that trembled from the depths of my heart, I cried sorrowfully, my whole body shaking. How long did I cry? Coming out of the main hall with a haggard face, a monk who must have been watching me carefully called me.

He took me to his room, offered candy, and said:

"What troubles do you have?"

I suddenly said to the monk I was meeting for the first time:

"I want to kill my father. I want to kill him and die myself."

It was the resentment stuck in my heart like a thorn under a fingernail.

"It's karma. You must have done wrong to your father in a past life."

He said lightly.

"Karma? Ah, I see."

I saw one cause of the pain that had been terribly tormenting me melt away right there.

Is there a time when everything is tied and untied? After that, I never felt any emotion toward my father again. My father became a complete stranger, and the peculiar thread of fate that had bound me and him was finally cut completely then.

I diligently read Introduction to Buddhism and the Agama Sutras. But from the time I took refuge in Buddhism as a religion, an even stronger disgust with life attacked me. I felt an intense temptation toward death.

But my mother was the problem for me. I couldn't die leaving my mother behind.

But my mother wanted to die just like me. She took painkillers every two hours. Now it seemed even painkillers would be useless, so she really wanted to die because of the pain.

"Mother, let's die together. I don't know why I should live."

My mother wailed.

Before dying, there was one more place I had to visit in my thoughts about death.

It was meeting Venerable Gusan.

Five years ago, when I followed a friend to meet the master, he asked us one thing:

"What is the most precious thing in the world?"

The people who went together said all sorts of things like love, justice, friendship.

"It's yourself. Without yourself, there's nothing."

Then before abandoning the most precious self, I had to meet him once.

The master's room was fragrant. Without any formality, I poured out to him directly:

"Master, I must die. There's no particular reason. There are only walls all around. There's no way to break through. But actually, I don't really want to die - I want to die because I want to live."

The master looked at me steadily as if pitying me.

"Give me your mind that wants to die. What does that mind look like?"

His question was firm. I was completely blocked. 'Give him my mind?'

"Look, don't you still not know what your mind that wants to die looks like?"

Though I didn't understand well, I seemed very foolish and he seemed to know much about the world that I didn't know.

"Find and bring your mind. Then a path to live will open clearly before you. A broad road will open."

"How do I find it?"

"What is the mind? What does it look like? What is this? Whether sleeping or awake, sitting or standing, walking or working, keep the question 'What is this?' like a hen brooding eggs. Then someday the mind will be clearly revealed."

Following that, he delivered surprising news:

"One who has found and awakened this mind is called Buddha, and one who hasn't awakened is called a sentient being."

My eyes opened wide.

"If I find and awaken my mind, can I also become Buddha?"

"That's right. Anyone can become Buddha if they make the effort."

If I just find my mind and become Buddha, it was worth doing. It was worth investing my entire life. It didn't seem particularly difficult.

From that day, I took up the hwadu "What is this?" (sisimma). I believed the master's words completely without a fingernail's worth of doubt.

While I was opening a path to live by going to that temple, it was a strange coincidence that my mother also turned back toward life. My mother had difficultly set her will to try to overcome her pain without relying on painkillers as much as possible.

I rushed to that master every Saturday, taking five or six hours.

Whenever he saw me, he immediately asked:

"Have you found your mind?"

"Not yet."

I tried desperately not to lose the hwadu for even a moment, like a cat catching a mouse, as he instructed.

After about three weeks passed? I said this in front of him:

"Happiness and unhappiness are within me. Everything exists in the world, but I only see what's in my mind. Light is transparent, but if I wear red clothes, only red is reflected. All causes are within me."

He was very pleased with my words and wrote me a poem. It was content blessing me to bloom like a lotus, and he also gave me the clear dharma name "Cheongnyangseong."

About a month later, I saw the phenomenon of division occurring in my life.

As I focused my mind on keeping the hwadu, I became negligent in my duties. It was difficult to be conscious of "What is this?" while running with children in the playground during PE class. I experienced conflict between work and the hwadu practice. My teacher's conscience was pricked. I had to give up one of the two. If I had to give up one, it would be my job.

I made up my mind to leave home and went to visit a large Buddhist nunnery for preliminary inspection.

As I approached the temple, I developed a severe headache.

I was guided to a room where about five nuns were sitting in a circle.

The nun who guided me introduced me:

"This bodhisattva says she wants to become a nun."

They looked me up and down with somehow unfavorable eyes and said mockingly:

"Someone like that won't last three days before going back out."

Others nodded in agreement. I was displeased as they seemed rude and arrogant. Did they think I wasn't destined to become a nun based on my appearance or attire? As I left the temple gate, I muttered:

"This temple is not the place for me."

When I concluded this, the continuing headache disappeared as if washed away.

I occasionally gave my mother hints, half-jokingly:

"I might become a nun."

"What nonsense deserving of lightning. Shaving your head, abandoning your old, sick mother?"

My mother didn't even respond as if my words weren't worth considering.

The next spring, I received an appointment as a middle school English teacher.

After about ten years of teaching, I found it difficult to have hope for the future of Korean education amid the overall injustice. It was clearly deviating from the normal track of education, and there was neither wisdom nor power to return it to its place. I saw the absence of character education and wanted to start character education myself at least in schools.

Using what I had read and heard as capital, I started with teacher training under the grand title of "Human Education" with a six-month plan. But I had to close my mouth after just the third lecture.

I cited the four great sages - Buddha, Jesus, Socrates, and Lao Tzu - as models of ideal humans.

But when I began talking about them, I realized I actually understood nothing about them. Their minds, actions, words. How could I understand their truth?

I saw myself again, blind even to the life before me, let alone the lives of sages.

I visited Master Gusan again.

"I don't understand anything."

"When you awaken, you'll know everything. Finding and awakening the mind is the work of a great hero."

"Master, can the mind really be seen?"

I confirmed.

"Yes."

He answered firmly.

"They say the mind has no form, color, or smell?"

"That's what those who can't see say. It can be seen."

"People say being deceived is life, but I don't want to be deceived by life and the world. I'll see the path and then walk it. I will definitely see my true self."

"Right. Awaken completely and become a true teacher. Become a real teacher."

The master encouraged me.

====================

My fellow teachers were very surprised to learn I was becoming a nun. In their eyes, I was a very passionate activist.

"Teacher Yoon, if someone told me to become a nun, I'd rather die."

The spinster geography teacher looked at me as if horrified.

All the faculty held a modest farewell party, so I, the guest of honor, dressed beautifully in pink hanbok and attended the party. The male teachers looked at me with complicated expressions as if it was regrettable. I drank several farewell drinks and returned home late with a flushed face.

My mother, not knowing anything, clicked her tongue while looking proudly at her beautiful daughter's appearance.

"Looking so lovely, why won't you get married?"

I steeled my heart. 'I leave tomorrow morning. Now is the time to tell her.'

"Mother, let's talk for a moment."

"What is it?"

My mother sat down awkwardly beside me.

"Well..."

The words wouldn't come out. Instead, my throat choked up first. My mother tensed.

"What's going on?"

"I'm leaving home tomorrow morning. I've decided to become a nun. I've submitted my resignation to the school and just came from the farewell party. Your nephew's family will take care of you."

I held my mother's arm, afraid she might faint.

My mother went to her room without saying anything.

I sat down in front of the vanity and asked and answered myself in the mirror.

"Look. You know how that woman has lived her whole life, don't you? If she just met a good man and had a plump son and grandson to hold, all the deep resentment and han would be resolved. Why can't you do what everyone else does? It's fate. It's fate."

Recalling Siddhartha's renunciation, I confirmed to myself repeatedly that my decision was not a sin.

I slept feeling rather relieved and when I went to my mother's room the next morning, I knew she had sat up all night.

My mother sat dazed as if her soul had left, constantly scratching the backs of her feet with her hands.

Since neither of us could eat, I immediately packed. Gray pants and a thick gray sweater, with just two sets of underwear in a bag - that was all.

I made a deep bow to my mother, signaling a long farewell. My mother had no expression, like someone who had lost their mind.

I gritted my teeth. I closed the apartment front door and walked out to the street looking for a taxi.

Then suddenly I heard my mother's voice calling my name. I looked back. She was chasing after me barefoot, shouting:

"My child! You can't go. Someone please catch her." My mother wailed.

Just then a taxi stopped in front of me, so I quickly got in and slammed the door.

"To the intercity bus terminal."

I absolutely didn't look back. Finally hot tears welled up, my whole body trembled, and sobs overwhelmed me. I covered my face with both hands and cried out loud. Tears flowed through my ten fingers.

The driver played the song "Busan Station of Farewell" for me.

"...Goodbye. Take care. The whistle of tears cries..."

I cried even more sadly along with the song. Ah! It was something I could never do again as a human being.

Daewonsa, a nunnery located halfway up Jiri Mountain.

"Go to Daewonsa. There's a well-cultivated elderly nun there, so practice under her."

It was the place Master Gusan had told me about.

I visited Venerable Beopil, the abbess of that temple and seventy-five years old.

The young nun who guided me told me in advance: "Bow three times."

After the first bow, that nun said:
"Oh, how frightening." After the second bow, she said again:
"Frightening indeed." I made the third bow without a word.
"Truly frightening."

"Venerable, what is so frightening?"

"Didn't a girl hang herself in that guest room a few days ago? Now I'm scared of girls coming to become nuns."

The story was that a month ago, a nurse had come wanting to become a nun.
The nuns gave her postulant clothes and let her stay at the temple.
And twenty days later, she took medicine and even hanged herself to death.
She had come with the wounds of lost love. The day I arrived was the day of her first memorial service.

The director told me with a stern attitude:

"You can't become a nun by watching nuns. Just look at Buddha and work hard."

Strange words. Don't look at the nuns you see when you open your eyes, but only look at the Buddha you can't see. I didn't point out any contradiction.

The first unwritten rule for postulants was not to argue. Since I had entered the path of meditation anyway, there was no need to look outside and judge.

The next day, postulant training began from dawn. From 3 AM to 9 PM, they gave no time to rest at all.

The kitchen of a large temple always had work piled up. I endlessly prepared vegetables, made side dishes, and washed dishes.

But I was so happy with such primary physical labor that required no mental effort. People praised me for being capable and diligent.

"Postulant, when did you study and when did you learn to work?"

They seemed very conscious of my education and career.

The temple had a clear hierarchy - everyone who shaved their head before me was my senior, so I had to obey even the orders of seventeen-year-olds.

Day after day buried in work, I had no time to think about the world I had left behind. By making the body extremely tired, they gave no room for stray thoughts.

Three months passed while working hard, eating well, sleeping well without any worries or anxieties.

The elderly nun called me.

"Why don't you shave your head now?"

"Do as you wish, Venerable."

That day I shaved my head completely. I felt only refreshment during the head-shaving ceremony, with no other emotions.

I washed my head and looked in the mirror. I had tried all kinds of hairstyles, but the nun's head that was in my fate pleased me most.

I was promoted from a back room postulant with hair to a main room postulant without hair. The main room was always subtly fragrant, spacious and neat.

Since it was winter, we bathed twice a month for the assembly, and that day was the temple's holiday.

After shaving my head, I bathed mixed with the nuns for the first time. I glimpsed a person reflected in the mirror. It was a bit unfamiliar. Looking again, it was me. I quickly turned my head.

There was a strange figure with a man's head on a woman's body in the mirror.

Looking at a pretty, small-bodied young nun wearing large men's underwear, I felt a bit sad.

Within a month, I memorized almost all the ritual texts, dedicatory prayers, and sutras used in temple ceremonies.

The instructor couldn't hide her amazement.

"Is there a tape recorder in your head, postulant?"

I displayed my temperament of having to be the best everywhere and lived spiritedly here too.

Then one day, my cousin couple came to visit me.

"We sold the apartment and got a separate room near our house for your mother. But it seems difficult to take care of her for long."

They showed reluctance. I could understand their difficulty without them saying it explicitly. My mother was crying day and night and lying down. Her presence would darken even their home like storm clouds.

"Go back and wait a little longer. I'll try to arrange something."

That afternoon the elderly nun called me.

"Your cousin came and went?"

"Yes."

"You're filled with worry. What's the matter?"

I told her about my mother.

"Bring her to the temple."

The elderly nun readily suggested.

I had seen how laypeople living in temples were treated by nuns. My mother had exceptionally strong pride. My mother wasn't someone who would readily donate large sums to temples, nor did she have large sums. But since my cousins said it was difficult, I had no choice but to fetch my mother.

My mother was overjoyed beyond measure when she saw me, as if a dead child had returned alive.

After selling even the remaining household goods and carrying only a suitcase of clothes, mother and daughter returned to the temple.

My mother stayed in a back room, which was the lowest treatment in the temple.

Back room people generally had to eat leftover food or cold rice from the main room.

Whenever my mother caught my eye, pain came to my heart. I gradually realized it was reckless to bring my mother while I was a postulant. My mother clearly made efforts to endure all difficulties to be by my side.

But before a month passed, trouble erupted. The kitchen was in an uproar, so I went out to see my mother sitting on the back room floor and the general affairs nun pointing at my mother and shouting:

"Old woman, just eat the rice you're given, how dare you interfere in the nuns' business. Get out immediately. If you don't leave, I will."

The general affairs nun spoke in banmal to my mother. Seeing me standing beside her, she went "Hmph" and turned away haughtily. The nuns and postulants standing around just made expressions of pity but no one said a word.

"What happened?" I asked my mother. My mother sighed painfully.

"Last night someone came asking to stay overnight. But the general affairs nun insisted on sending them away. So I said to the grandmother next to me, 'If it were me, I would have let them stay. Where will that person go in this mountain at night?' The general affairs nun must have heard it in the bathhouse. She came this morning and made that scene."

"So mother, I told you to watch your words. This place is like a knife's edge."

The general affairs nun was thirty-four years old from Seoul who had dropped out of college. I had noticed early on that she had a subtle competitive consciousness toward me. Her behavior clearly had the intention of breaking my spirit from the beginning.

The next morning, someone told me my mother was looking for me, and when I went, she had already packed her bag.

"If I stay here, I'll make you a cripple too."

My mother seemed determined.

"You have nowhere to go."

"I have to go anywhere."

I went down the mountain with my mother.

'A compassionate order?'

In that temple where dozens of nuns lived, my mother was expelled for a trivial reason, and no one said a word about the injustice. Deep doubt arose along with anger.

I went to Gwangju and stopped by the house of Vice Principal Kim, with whom I had a connection. She became widowed at twenty-five and had a son who was a university professor, and had held great expectations for me as an educator.

"That's why I said what I said. There's no nun in Korean temples who can teach Teacher Yoon, didn't I say? I told you not to leave home so much." She scolded me back.

I looked for nursing homes. I thought washing the soiled clothes of pitiful elderly people would be more certain practice. But I was rejected at all seven nursing homes I visited.

I wanted to work with my head shaved, but most were Christian foundations.

"Mother. There's no way. Let's go back."

My mother and I, with nowhere to return, parted in Jinju. I was afraid that if we went to Busan together, I might not be confident about returning to the sangha.

I couldn't abandon my intention to leave home no matter what anyone said, and I didn't want to grow my shaved hair again.

My mother on the bus pressed her face against the window and cried out loud looking at me. I couldn't cry because of a nun's face. Everyone was looking at our mother and daughter.

Some women on the bus, seeming to understand the situation, wiped tears from their eyes. The bus left carrying my mother who was crying desperately.

I trudged up into Jiri Mountain. The darkening mountain was desolate. I came to where the valley water crashed and roared together and finally collapsed on a rock.

A place where I wouldn't be seen by others and where my wailing wouldn't be heard because of the water sound. I sat with my legs stretched out and cried as much as I wanted, screaming. I cried, flailing my legs, pounding the ground with my palms.

I screamed looking up at the sky:

"Buddha, listen. I will not be born again in the human world after this life ends. I'm going to the Pure Land. I will definitely go to that place without suffering. I won't be born here again. Do you hear me?"

When it became pitch dark, I arrived at the temple. People glanced at me furtively.

"Postulant, we all thought you wouldn't come back." Someone whispered.

"No. The director told me something. She said you can't be a nun by watching nuns. Now I understand what that means. I will be a nun trusting only myself."

I approached the Buddha statue and vowed while glaring as if I would devour the Buddha:

"I will absolutely not retreat until I reach where I want to go!"

From the next day, I returned to being a spirited postulant as if nothing had happened.

That summer was very dry. The temple held a rain prayer ceremony.

The elderly nun said: "If a dragon-year nun dances naked with a pot lid on their head, it will rain."

The nuns giggled. Not knowing about the meditation hall practitioners, looking around the main room members, there were three or four dragon-years. The elderly nun was also a dragon-year.

I said: "You're a dragon-year, Venerable. You dance."

The elderly nun glared at me and said:

"You're also a dragon-year. Hey, dance today. It's so dry we'll have a bad harvest."

I answered: "It's not difficult."

That night, an extraordinary show took place in the temple's backyard.

White balloon flowers were in full bloom in the empty lot next to the jars. I danced in the balloon flower field. I was naked with an iron pot lid on my head.

The nuns sat on the wooden floor watching, and Won-don shone two flashlights to create highlights. The moon was in the sky and several black clouds floated by.

While I was dancing for a while, clouds gathered and a few raindrops fell.

Either the dragon god was charmed by the nun's sensuality and dribbled a little, or found it so funny he leaked urine.

The next day when I reported this to the elderly nun, she tried hard to suppress laughter, her large belly shaking.

"Hey! That's really miraculous. Then dance once more in broad daylight in front of the main hall next time. A shower will definitely come."

This time I glared at the elderly nun.

The life of postulants and nuns who had been ordained for just 2-3 years was extremely difficult.

My dharma sister, a thirty-eight-year-old nun, pursued her own style of practice terribly.

She bowed 1,000 times daily, worked all day without rest, and sat up at night to sleep. The purpose of sitting was not to sleep, but she was always dozing.

Once when we went to the valley together to do laundry, when the sound of the washing stick suddenly stopped, I looked back to see her dozing while holding the stick. With frightening determination, she continuously pushed her body.

There was also this incident. The morning service performed in temples is incomparably reverent and solemn. But my dharma sibling postulant didn't get up after prostrating.

The elderly nun behind waddled closer and kicked the prostrated postulant's bottom with her foot. The postulant was startled and jumped up. She had fallen asleep prostrating.

I too sometimes wanted to rest and sleep even if I had to starve for days. During my time at that temple, if I lay down at 9:10 PM, I always fell asleep immediately before counting one, two, three, and it was morning when I woke.

People in their prime twenties, after being tormented for just 2-3 months, experienced imbalance with no menstruation for months.

People were always soaked in fatigue. The elders always said:

"If you think about your body, when will you practice? Consider yourself not born in this life and set aside your body."

After eleven months as a postulant, I received ordination and officially became a samaneri (novice nun).

That winter for three months, I volunteered to take on the duty of cooking rice for the assembly as the rice cook.

Including guests coming and going, there would be almost 70-80 people.

I had a plan to finish this work and leave Daewonsa.

My health had become very poor from a year of excessive labor.

When I was young, I had fallen from a cliff and received a slight shock to my spine, and that cause began to manifest due to severe labor. My back bent and my body tilted to five minutes before six o'clock.

When I opened my eyes at dawn, I could barely sit up from my spot, but my limbs wouldn't move, making it hard even to fold my blanket. Won-gwang, who slept next to me, always folded my blanket and put it in the attic. I crawled out to light the fire and cook rice.

While serving as rice cook, I decided to read the Self-Admonition Sutra three thousand times in three months. It was an admonitory text for guarding oneself, and I thought if I just followed its contents well in life, I wouldn't leave major flaws as a nun, so I decided to engrave its contents into my bones.

Reading once took 10 minutes, so even reading intensively while sitting required over 6 hours daily, so I operated at full capacity for 18 hours. It was my new hwadu.

Never accept good clothes or good food
Don't be stingy with your own possessions, don't covet others' things
Keep your mouth heavy, don't move your body carelessly
Make good friends and distance yourself from bad friends
Don't sleep before the third watch
Don't respect yourself and look down on others
When seeing wealth and the opposite sex, face them with right thoughts
Don't become close with worldly people and incur other nuns' hatred and jealousy
Don't criticize others' faults too much
Always keep your mind equal when dealing with the assembly
Even if you work hard enough to carve bones, reach liberation in this life.

The director instructed me:

"If rice grains fall in the drain, Lord Indra sheds tears until they rot. So be careful with rice grains."

I strained the rice grains from the dishwater through a sieve and ate them after washing. Construction workers always spilled rice on the table and stuck it all over their bowls. I gathered and washed all of that to eat.

December 8th is Enlightenment Day (the day Buddha attained enlightenment), so from December 1st to 8th, we meditated and prayed without sleeping.

The director said:

"The main room members will pray in the main hall. Let's pray hard for 8 days without putting our backs to the ground."

We said we would do so. Each person had to strike the wooden bell twice a day for 2 hours in rotation. I also had to strike the wooden bell once in the morning and once at night, and the night time was really difficult. After working outside in the cold for hours, when I held the wooden bell, sleep immediately poured in. It was a prayer form of repeatedly calling only the name of Shakyamuni Buddha with the same tone while striking.

Suddenly someone poked my back from behind. When I quickly looked back, the nuns were giggling. Instead of Shakyamuni Buddha, I had been continuously chanting "Western love, Western love." I must have really loved Buddha.

As promised, I didn't lie down for 8 days, but others weren't complete fools like me.

On the night before the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, I stayed up all night reading the Self-Admonition Sutra. I fell short of my goal of 3,000 times. Tomorrow at 10 AM was the end of the retreat. Because my body was so exhausted, even reading while dipping my face in a basin of water, sleep poured in.

Then a strange phenomenon occurred. When I was about to doze, a frost-like sound of the bamboo stick struck my ear, and at that moment I became completely awake.

Something invisible was helping my work, and that phenomenon continued until dawn, finally allowing me to achieve my goal.

Usually there was a sound that woke me - a clear water drop sound would ring in my ears.

During the year I was at that temple, whenever I dozed while studying, that clear and beautiful sound always woke me.

On the morning of the retreat closing day, at the seat evaluating three months of practice, the elderly nun praised my effort and devotion in front of dozens of assembly members. She blessed that I would definitely achieve kensho and become a Buddha.

The next morning I went to the elderly nun.

"Venerable, I must leave the temple. I need to practice beside my mother."

"No. You must practice among the assembly."

"I can continue on my own."

"If I say no, know that it's no and withdraw."

I went to her the next day and the day after to ask permission.

"If you want to leave the temple, grow your hair and leave!"

The next morning I secretly ran away.

I found my mother. My mother was being cared for by my friend, former colleagues, and former students' parents.

"Sunim, how much water is in a human body? Even crying for a year, tears come out every day."

My mother was someone who couldn't understand me, and she definitely had excessive affection and attachment to me. My mother tried to resolve the han she had gained from the world through me.

"It can't be helped. I'll be a nun in Busan and take care of you. Don't worry."

After that, I lived as a temple employee at a temple called Bodeoksa for three years.

I was a nun who struck the wooden bell in the dharma hall. I also received offerings of 100,000 won monthly as salary.

Though I, who had left on a difficult path seeking truth, was performing prayers and memorial services, I wasn't distressed by that situation. I believed in my own wishes and abilities.

Thinking of nuns who just eat prepared rice without lifting a finger and only do sitting meditation, I studied the hwadu without letting my guard down for even a moment.

I was too greedy and eventually became ill. My face turned dark yellow and my eyes were always bloodshot. Whenever I sat, I dozed, but it wasn't sleep - it was exhaustion. I was stubbornly persisting while watching my body crumble like ash.

One day I met a man who called himself Korea's best doctor. Seeing me, he said immediately:

"Sunim, if you continue like that for five more years, you'll either die or never be able to practice again."

He knew my painful areas better than I did. So I believed his words.

"Rest for three years. It takes three years to recover. Will you force it for five more years and end it forever, or rest well for three years and try with a healthy body until death?"

I chose the latter. By some fate, he guaranteed he would take responsibility and make me completely healthy.

The medicine he prepared was incredibly expensive.

"I have no money."

"Become a real abbot someday in the future."

He wanted me to repay by becoming an excellent seeker.

When I released the tension, I saw myself without strength to even clean a floor.

The doctor shook his head repeatedly.

"Sunim, are all nuns this stubborn? It's scary. How did you do that work with this body?"

For the past four years, I had driven myself until I felt extreme fatigue every day. Days when I wasn't soaked in fatigue made me dissatisfied and even feel guilty.

'When will I achieve Buddhahood with this level of effort? Work harder,' I whipped myself.

I must have bowed hundreds of thousands more times with my bent back and called the names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas tens of millions more times. I also read the Diamond Sutra thousands of times until I memorized it completely. And above all, I struggled not to lose the question "What is this?" while watching my every movement. For me, hwadu practice and being a nun had the same meaning. If not for that practice, I had no reason to be a nun.

And the result? I lost my health. I didn't come to know anything I wanted to know. Because they said it wasn't something to be taught but something to realize and see for oneself, I didn't think to learn from the beginning. And believing that the path to self-realization was hwadu practice, I had to give my all and wait until that moment of enlightenment.

A sick nun was a burden in temples. The doctor couple took me to their home and nursed me with utmost care for three months. I ate, slept, played, and rested without thinking about enlightenment or hwadu or anything. I entrusted my body to the doctor and acted only as he instructed.

Six months later I moved again. It was a remote village in Jeolla Province.

There was an empty house in an isolated place turned away from the village. One room and a kitchen. A desolate place where you couldn't see a human shadow even after a month.

I exiled myself there. No place welcomed someone sick and unable to work, and being alone with lost health, my confidence had disappeared. I who had boasted I could do anything now saw myself unable to do anything. Recovering health was my only supreme task.

The doctor had particularly demanded that I control and regulate food and emotions. He said I absolutely shouldn't do anything that strains the mind and body.

I never deviated even 10 minutes from wake time, bedtime, walk time, meal time. Instructed to chew each spoonful of rice 30 times, I counted and chewed a hundred times, so it took over 30 minutes to eat half a bowl of rice.

As autumn deepened, red persimmons dropped throughout the mountain, but I didn't pick and eat more than two a day. If I broke twigs for firewood for just 10 minutes, my urine turned bright yellow, so I had to lie down for two hours to relieve 10 minutes of fatigue before it returned to its normal color.

As winter deepened, the small bungalow was completely buried in snow. I didn't go outside for days, scooping snow from in front of the kitchen door to melt and use that water.

One day the sun shone brilliantly and the snow melted warmly. I went up the back mountain and sat next to a persimmon tree in the sun. The persimmons had frozen solid into persimmon ice cream. I ate it and it was really sweet and delicious. Feeling good, I came home and looked in the mirror for the first time in a while, and my eyes shone with joy. Red energy had risen on both my cheeks. I saw the flame of my life reviving.

From then on, energy began to return little by little, and I looked in the mirror every day.

Knowing energy was rising, the first thing I attempted was sitting meditation. First 10 minutes, the next day 30 minutes, an hour, two hours - before long I rapidly recovered health enough to sit in meditation for 8 hours without feeling particularly tired. For the first time since becoming a nun, I could do sitting meditation as I wanted without being disturbed by people.

I had a dream.

Someone placed a blank sheet of paper in front of me.

"Write!"

He commanded in one word. I immediately wrote:

"I wish to achieve the spring of dharma and save sentient beings."

Waking from the dream, I was pleased.

I loved my heart that didn't forget its own wishes even in dreams.

I read the Thousand Hands Sutra 9 times and the Diamond Sutra 3 times daily without fail, and spent the rest in sitting meditation.

Just as my old mother worried only about me day and night, I lived embracing the hwadu like that. 'What is this?' What is the essence of all this? What is the substance of mind?

I waited for truth to be revealed before my eyes, guarding the hwadu like a cat catching a mouse lest I miss that moment. Immersed in it daily, practice went smoothly to the point of forgetting time passing.

But one day, a question suddenly arose. 'If I sit alone in the mountains like this, pursuing one question, and one day enlightenment opens and I become Buddha, what meaning would that Buddha have in the world?'

I fell into doubt.

'A lotus must be rooted in mud to bloom. Can one achieve Buddhahood apart from sentient beings?'

I couldn't deny the fact that I was away from sentient beings' lives, away from the pond.

'If I become Buddha this way, I'll decline that Buddha. Shakyamuni Buddha taught that he achieved Buddhahood by accumulating endless merit.'

No matter how generously I looked at it, I couldn't see what I was doing now as becoming great merit. I concluded for myself:

"I cannot become Buddha this way."

From that day on, I abandoned the hwadu without regret.

A pathless path is never a path. Return to people? But just as when I left, I had realized nothing about truth. What could I teach when I returned? Since I didn't know any dharma that could help their lives, I was nothing but a beggar getting free meals wearing nun's clothes.

I finally called to Buddha in despair:

"Buddha, I cannot reach that world you saw before meeting you. But how do I meet you? You're said to be in the Pure Land, but I don't know the way there. Please come find me. I will wait for you. I have no other way but to wait for you."

They said meditation is the work of those without work, but I had abandoned even that work, so I was merely existing. Breathing - that was the last evidence that I was alive. I made observing breath my daily routine. I spent time sitting all day watching breath coming and going.

When even that became tedious, I went to the stream and sang songs of longing sadly. It was the part Chunhyang sang missing Lee Do-ryeong.

'I shall go, I shall go. I shall follow my beloved and go. I'll follow even a thousand li, I'll go even ten thousand li. Even over Dongseollyeong Pass that wind and clouds cross over, that swift-winged falcons and eagles all cross over, I shall follow my beloved. The Weaver Girl in heaven is blocked by the Milky Way but still meets once a year, but what water blocks the place where my beloved is that I cannot see him so? Even now, let me quickly die and become a swallow in the March east wind, build a nest on the eaves where my beloved is, meet my beloved at night and have our long-awaited reunion. What to do, what to do, what to do with a world without my beloved, collapsing alone crying.'

In the Diamond Sutra, there are these words:

Subhuti asked the Tathagata:

"Will there be those who believe Buddha's teachings even in the Age of Dharma Decline 2,500 years later?"

"Subhuti, don't say such things. Even then there will be those who keep precepts and cultivate merit, generating a stream of pure faith."

The Tathagata also said:

"The Tathagata sees what is and speaks of what is, speaking only truth without lies."

I prayed toward heaven:

"You said you see all this with the eye of enlightenment and speak no lies. Look at me. I am that person who believes in you. Don't abandon me."

I also prayed like this:

"I wish to meet one who has reached the highest enlightenment in this world and learn under them."

I sought the supreme teacher. If I met a second-best, I'd have to search for the first teacher again.

As breathing deepened, I wasn't hungry. Even eating one meal a day, I didn't feel hunger and my body was comfortable. I began to harbor another absurd ambition.

'If I could live without eating, that would be a great state. Can I live on just air and water?'

I thought I might reach that state through breathing techniques, so I attempted it.

For 40 days I gradually reduced food. After a few days I stopped eating grains and ate a little milk and honey, eventually living on one spoonful of honey a day, and finally just water. I had never experienced such a comfortable state. With no disturbance in body or mind, sleeping just three or four hours a day, I sat all day with clear mind without awareness of time or body.

I didn't want to put anything in my body besides water to disturb that peace. But when I actually reached a state where I couldn't accept anything but water, I suddenly became scared. It seemed I might die alone in the mountains if I wasn't careful. I boiled thin rice gruel with a handful of rice and two bowls of water.

Just then the doctor came from Busan to get me. The landlord wanted to use the house himself and asked me to vacate. The doctor had visited me once 40 days ago. He opened the rice container and was shocked. The rice was still there.

I had no courage to stubbornly stay in a house being asked to vacate, so I moved out. It was fortunate. But again I had nowhere to go.

I went to my old friend Cheol-suk's house in Seoul. Understanding my situation, she said she had bought 200 pyeong of land and a house in Okgok next to Gwangyang in Jeolla Province and told me to go stay there.

I went there with my mother. It was slightly turned away from the village but not particularly remote. In front of the house was a reservoir as wide as a lake.

Though it wasn't a life fit for humans, just being with me reassured my mother. The year and a half in Okgok gave me hellish suffering, so just thinking about it makes my head shake involuntarily. There were difficult trials.

I sat holding my breath daily when a strange phenomenon occurred.

Enormous appetite arose and nothing but food appeared before my eyes. I was appalled at myself thinking only of eating from the moment I opened my eyes. But I couldn't eat as desired - half a bowl of rice and one bowl of porridge was my daily food allowance.

My mother said I had caught something like false hunger and was dumbfounded. The state of feeling only appetite lasted three or four months. Unable to bear it, my mother cooked a pot of glutinous rice and a pot of beef soup. She told me not to eat from a bowl but just to eat directly from the pot. It was a folk remedy for people with false hunger. Helplessly, I ate rice wildly from the pot as my mother instructed.

After that, the symptoms seemed to disappear. Then next, strong sexual desire seized my body and mind.

When breathing deeply, breath pushed forcefully down below the navel, pounding the sexual center. It was unbearable. I couldn't tell my mother. Fighting fierce sexual desire, my temperament became increasingly savage. I was unbearably angry at myself. I harassed my mother. My mother pitied me and endured everything. I desperately held down my mind that wanted to burst outside.

'All thoughts sentient beings create are dreams, illusions, bubbles, and dew, so should be seen thus.'

I held onto the last verse of the Diamond Sutra as a pillar, fighting the flames of desire engulfing me.

'It will pass. Everything changes and will pass.'

After three or four months, the flames gradually died down. But next, an even greater temptation awaited. Was it the last human instinct of species preservation?

I suddenly wanted a son. In my feeling, this desire was the most intense and hard to bear. Anyone would do as a partner. I wanted to throw away seeking truth and everything, just get one son and live the rest of my life as if dead in a seaside village secretly.

Unable to bear the burning desire, I circled the yard and room like mad.

I finally ran to the telephone office. To call Cheol-suk asking her to send a wig and clothes. But standing before the phone, I shook my head.

'No, I shouldn't.'

After this incident, the storm-like trials that had lasted nearly a year slowly receded.

I thirsted for truth again with severe thirst. My diary from that time has these passages written:

#### March 10, 1986
Buddha, let me feel you in everything. I want to become your true disciple. Let me reach there through your guidance. Choose me to continue your wisdom lineage.

#### March 11, 1986
Buddha. A butterfly gives hope to all flowers just by being a butterfly. What could a worm help with? Becoming a butterfly is the only best thing. Nail the death of the cocoon to my coffin.

#### June 27, 1986
A gamble investing an entire life.
If you don't seek by throwing your entire existence, you cannot reach there.
Cannot turn back. Turning back is impossible. I will strive until the end of this life, that moment. I must see the end of this beginningless ignorance. And I must see the beginning when the gates of hell open.
The beginning and end of my prayer is seeing my true reality.

August 28, 1986
You. Become a Buddha Bird.
A bird burning with aspiration for Buddha.
A Fire Bird burning itself with the fire of seeking truth.

October 29, 1986
Don't seek pleasure. Seeking is suffering. This path is sunlight, desert, winter.
This place is not the east, nor the side of rising life.
Sunset. Thirst. Disappearance. Death. One sitting facing west. Frustration. Prayer of complete suicide. Accept all this suffering as natural. Mind and body are tortured daily.
You have already entered this path. Gray robe. Brown robes.
Don't look back. There's nothing there. Mirage. Empty hands flailing.

November 6, 1986
Morning. The sense of despair that attacks when I open my eyes. Pressure about this difficult life. Want to escape.
Remaining years. The long journey I must endure. But in the end, the life of seeking truth that must be experienced. I cannot do anything else besides this work.
Will like Mount Tai. Great will that nothing can topple. Unless whole with burning aspiration, cannot go.
Even if any desire interferes, absorb it into the single desire. The desire for enlightenment.
Thus make only the desire for enlightenment burn more and more.

November 24, 1986
Painful. Thoughts of wanting to die arise suddenly. The despair that drove me to the brink of death in the past revives. Suffering without exit.
Can't do anything about it. What can I do? This strange situation where I can do nothing.
Groaning while holding the wall. What is happening?

November 27, 1986
Dying while alive? Dead with such a passionately alive heart? Is such forcing possible?
But they say. If you don't die, you won't be able to live. Consider yourself not born for this life.
Is giving up this difficult?
But trusting what can I fold up this life?
Let's fold. Folding. Don't suffer. How could you know the beauty of paradise without passing through hell?
Become a living corpse. Actually aren't you a living corpse? You who cannot see though you have eyes. You who doesn't even know yourself.

I wandered endlessly between hope and despair, will and abandonment, desire and frustration.

The one thing I steadily did while holding and beating and soothing my own mind was watching my own ever-changing thoughts.

I wanted to meet Buddha and hear the facts.

'Lord, what do you want me to do in this life? Where is your will?'

What can I truly do for the Lord? What do I want to do?

'What form of life can bring me close to you? Please reveal it.'

I pestered daily.

"Show me the truth. Until I see it, I can do nothing."

No matter how much I called, Buddha didn't say a word to me or show me anything.

One day I realized that he had passed away. And I came to want a living teacher.

Where is a living Buddha? It was hopeless. I prayed for him to call me, but there was no news.

One morning after staying up all night with fever longing for a teacher, I left aimlessly to find a teacher. But I returned to Okgok after just three days.

And for the first time, I prayed to God toward heaven.

"God, guide me to live on the right path with a right mind."

That's when it happened. Suddenly my clasped hands began trembling, then my whole body shook. Surprised, I tried to stop my body's movement but couldn't control it. My body shook freely like a boat on waves. I quickly put on my robe. I sat in lotus position and put my hands together.

"Buddha, what is this? I wanted nothing but kensho and becoming Buddha. I didn't want any other power."

Despite my prayer, the force surrounding me lifted my body and turned it around once. I shouted:

"Demon, retreat! How dare you invade here? Get back!"

When I used all my strength to resist being swept by that force, sweat flowed all over my body, soaking the floor. When I collapsed exhausted, that force turned my lying body around once more.

After being spun around all night, the next morning was a bit calmer. My hands placed on my knees moved automatically.

My fingers were pressing acupoints. When I left it alone, it pressed acupoints throughout my body for two hours.

I fought this force day and night for a week. I couldn't sleep or eat properly.

I wanted to know the identity of this force but couldn't, and couldn't understand the truth of what was happening to me. When I wished for death, that force immediately blocked my breathing.

When I thought 'So this is how I die,' I cried out:

"Buddha, it's unfair. It's unfair that I became a nun but die without seeing truth."

At that moment, breathing returned to normal as if nothing had happened. I needed someone to examine me.

My mother, watching my condition, was terrified and said:

"Buddha, that nun is not my child. She's Buddha's disciple, so Buddha should take care of her."

Unable to bear it, I visited a senior nun in Seoul. Hearing about my situation, she said:

"You are the master. Now ride it and act freely."

The moment I heard this, I was hungry for the first time in days.

"Please give me some food."

And I went to Hae-wol-gwang in Gwangju.

She had set up a 'Mind Study Research Center' and was guiding about 200 members. A month ago, when I was wandering looking for a teacher, I had stopped there. At that time she severely scolded me:

"Sunim, you've been ordained for 6 years but have nothing to show. Why come down to the world empty-handed? Either stay secluded in the mountains for 10 or 20 years until you get one realization, or if you can't do that, take off your robes..."

I couldn't say anything. But I firmly resolved in my heart:

"I will see the end."

A month after that incident, I visited Hae-wol-gwang again.

"I received confirmation of kensho."

She doubted my words. When I told her everything that had happened truthfully, she seemed to believe a little.

The next day I gave a dharma talk to members at her research center.

My eyes shone bright blue and were frightening, and worldly matters that fit together in my thoughts flowed out smoothly as words in perfect order.

All the audience was captured by my power, and some people leaned their bodies forward as if enchanted, drawn into my dazzling words.

When the lecture ended, Hae-wol-gwang presented me with a bouquet.

"Congratulations on kensho."

People crowded around me pouring praise.

"What woman gave birth to such a sunim?"

The sick asked me to stroke their bodies with my hands.

I returned to Daewonsa with one intention.

I said nothing at first and spent several days.

But one day a certain meditation master came and gathered the assembly to give a dharma talk.

He spoke like an enlightened person, so I immediately followed him to his room.

"Can I ride this thing and go around freely?"

I asked, and he answered somewhat uncertainly:

"Yes."

But for some reason, he left hurriedly without even having lunch.

I told only the elderly nun what had happened to me, and she said it was joyous news but cautioned me not to tell others yet.

As time passed, I couldn't cover the doubts that arose on their own.

I was tired of holding and guarding myself in the dark world. So I wanted to consider that I had achieved kensho and was now at a level where I could live as my heart desired.

But I couldn't deceive myself. The principles of the world weren't visible to my eyes, so I was still blind. If I had seen anything while experiencing that, it was my mind when facing death. It was the mind of a seeker who could offer themselves as sacrifice on the altar of truth.

I had hopes and had cultivated them to fill my heart.

If the reason I was living, should live, being confirmed was kensho, then I had achieved kensho.

There was no other meaning.

A month later I left Daewonsa. The elderly nun shouted behind my back:

"You must come back! Come back!"

I didn't answer.

My mother moved to Busan again and stayed at my friend's house. Having left Daewonsa, I lived off my mother's charity.

To live as a nun, there were three paths:

One was to push through with meditation until awakening and seeing truth on one's own.
For that, one had to sit in meditation halls or seclude oneself in hermitages.

Next was reading scriptures and transmitting sounds one doesn't understand.

Or striking the wooden bell and managing temple affairs.

I rejected all three.

I had no place to stand. Losing my support, I wandered alone on city streets.

**Meeting**

There weren't many people on the moving bus. I was absently watching the city scenery flowing past the window.

Then someone gently tapped my shoulder, so I turned my head that way.

A man was blushing and acting familiar.

He carefully started talking to me:

"Sunim [i.e. master], may I ask you something?"
