# Publisher's Note

I, an English speaker, asked some AI software to translate this into English.

I made multiple translations and they came out materially differently each time.

The prompt I used for the following translation asked the translator to tell the truth, not make up anything, and to translate directly, but to make a translation which actually can be understood in English (since some phrases do not intelligibly translate when truly literal.)

But sometimes AI makes stuff up, and I am unable to verify or vouch for this translation, so beware of taking it as canonical or authoritative or even true to the original content.

It would be a great and worthwhile goal for someone who speaks Korean natively to carefully check this translation and to please suggest to this publisher any corrections they might like to see made.

Original Korean source material follows English translation.

**Yoon So-yeon**

**Meeting**

There weren't many people on the moving bus. I was absentmindedly looking at the cityscape flowing past the window.

Then someone lightly tapped my shoulder, so I turned my head in that direction.

A man with a reddened face was acknowledging me.
That person carefully started speaking.

"Monk, may I ask one thing?"
"Yes. Please ask."
"By any chance, have you seen a truthful person around you?"

I was a bit flustered. He continued speaking alone without caring about the gazes of people around us.

"I know Buddha's law but have nowhere to transmit that teaching. If monk tells me where there is a truthful person, I will also tell monk where what you want is."

I carefully observed his appearance and words.

"How far are you going?"

He answered he was going to Yeongdo, and since I had to get off at Choryang, I hesitated briefly and asked.

"May I treat you to a cup of tea?"

We moved our steps to a tea house.

He asked me about Buddha's teachings, but I couldn't answer with certainty, so I was embarrassed.
He carefully began to talk about Shakyamuni's life and teachings.
With a cup of tea in front of us, we exchanged conversation for over 4 hours and forgot about time. Only when we heard the employee say business hours were over did we prepare to get up.

"Monk, I don't know if we'll meet again or not. Monk, what is your wish? With this meeting as our connection, I can grant one of your wishes."

I hesitated for a moment then spoke honestly.

"I want to see my truth."

He laughed heartily.

"When monk becomes a truthful person, you can see your own truth. You must obtain truth, build it, and see its fruit."

He handed me his business card and asked me to contact him if I had time.

The next morning, I dialed his phone number.

His wife answered, and from her tone of voice, it seemed he wasn't treated well at home.
He came out to meet me at the bus stop and led me to his house with light steps.
It was a house in a good location with quite a large area and was valuable, but he rented out 4 rooms and the household goods were very modest.

He took me into a small room, sat facing me, held both hands and concentrated his mind, chanting "Namu Heaven Above Heaven Below Maitreya Buddha."
I followed what he did.
"Monk has roots."
He diagnosed me.
"I am the one who has reached the highest enlightenment in the world and I call myself Tathagata.
No one in this world can surpass my wisdom."

'Tathagata?' I was slightly shocked. But there was no need to easily deny it.
'I don't know anything about this person yet. Just because I can't see now doesn't mean I can deny facts as non-facts, and it's also foolish to believe without seeing.
Let's wait and see about this.'

"This world is in crisis. People must place the meaning of life in saving themselves."

I too could see the world perishing.

"How do I save myself?"
"If you save the world, you will save yourself."
"Then saving the world is most urgent. I will save the world."

I naturally agreed with his words. I could understand in my heart that he knew how to save the world.
I could just understand his words, because those words were all facts.

"I was once recognized by a great monk as having realized myself."

Since he was treating me too much like a young student, I tried to assert myself a little.
He immediately countered.

"What on earth do you have that you say you've also realized?"

I was speechless and closed my mouth again.

"If a blind person opens their eyes, they will see for themselves. Then every time they see the world, they will know whether their eyes are open or closed, and enlightenment is also like this."

He was saying what I wanted to hear.

"Enlightenment is not easily achieved. Only when a heart that neither heaven nor earth can move blooms from within after good roots bloom and bear fruit countless times can one finally obtain enlightenment.
If enlightenment could be obtained through books, why didn't enlightened ones emerge from among the countless practitioners of the past, and if one could advance to enlightenment through prayer or asceticism, how could there have been no such people in the past?
Enlightenment comes only through merit.
First, there must be roots within oneself, and next one must obtain that foundation - it's the same principle as a seed needing land to bear fruit."

The term enlightenment he used referred only to 'Buddha's enlightenment.'

"If there is someone wrong who calls themselves enlightened, such a person must have problems, so take me to them.
Such a person will not want to meet me, or even if they meet me, they won't be able to answer anything, so you will be able to see the truth."

He gave me a book, an autobiography honestly recording his 40 years of life.
The title of the book was 'Lonely Struggle,'
On the back cover was written 'I dedicate this book to those who are frustrated and lonely in a society where faith has become clouded.'

His education was elementary school, and he said he never read books, yet writing an autobiography by hand was extraordinary.
The journey of a life that became an orphan at age 9, grew up receiving all kinds of trials from the world, but protected himself with only the conscience and courage seeking happiness and emotion, was nakedly revealed.
He firmly believed that conscience and courage were most necessary to bless his life, and also felt this was the promise between humans and God.
Therefore, his life, which had to live in an increasingly darkening world, was a continuous struggle. His outstanding conscience could not tolerate the injustices he repeatedly encountered in the world.
He had an intense love for his country and nation and wanted to use his abilities as president. In preparation, he ran for congress twice in his 20s and 30s, but people didn't recognize his truth and ability.
However, his voice was quite loud in the opposition.

I could feel that he was the owner of a tremendous conscience through one anecdote he told me.

Around April 1983, a stranger visited his house.
That person came to visit every day for several days and continued to persuade and threaten him.
"Will you eat well and live well? Or will you become an innocent criminal in this era?"
He even showed his resident registration card and made the following proposal.
"Look here, Mr. Lee. I'll give you wealth that can make your family live abundantly for life. I promise to arrange permits and land that can become enormous rights. There's one condition for providing this to you. Lower your voice."
The strange visitor threatened him not to speak the truth about the world.
When he heard those words, he couldn't stop the tears flowing unconsciously.
After crying for a long time, he finally answered.
"I have no use for money."
That person left and came again the next day, muttering to himself.
'No use for money?'
He watched him with an expression mixed with wonder and admiration, tilting his head.
He knew his situation better than his family, so he couldn't understand his attitude of refusing the enormous rights he was offering.
Hearing such stories, I thought he was a rare conscience owner in this era.

One day I met a friend who had long been acquainted with him. I asked the friend.

"I'll ask just one thing about this person, so please swear to tell me the truth."
"Yes," the friend took a serious attitude.
"Have you ever seen this person deceive others and cause harm?"
I threw this question with a praying heart, and the friend immediately answered confidently.
"No. This friend is absolutely not someone who harms others."
I judged from his words and expression that the answer was truthful.
"Then I won't ask anything more about this person."

I had learned everything I wanted to know about him through his friend.

He told me in detail how enlightenment came to him. The content was as follows.

====================

In the dark world, I was very lonely and frustrated. The people around me always showed words and actions that disappointed me. My heart, which was anxious about worldly affairs, held me and made me only drink, and seeing myself becoming increasingly powerless, I knew my dreams for the country and nation were being defeated.
I decided on a new course for my life and told my wife my decision, but at first she strongly opposed it. I wanted to leave home and live buried in a remote place for perhaps several years, so I searched for a place where I could stay. After spending almost a year, I secured one place, which was a small island called Yeonhwa-ri, Yokji-myeon, Tongyeong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do.
Even right before leaving after giving up on worldly affairs, I couldn't bear the frustration of seeing people's ignorance and the fate they would face in the future, so I lamented with this poem.

Since conscience becomes a sin, there's nowhere to stand
Having experienced hardships through eternity, there's nowhere to unfold.
Possessing the abilities of a thousand people but unable to use them
Is being born into this world only fate!

On November 13, 1984, unable to change myself after coming to the world, becoming a criminal who wasn't a criminal, I requested the path of exile to a remote island in the middle of the sea, and through this, everything about myself began to be revealed. No one visited my residence, and there was no one to meet, so I could stabilize my mind that had been exhausted for a long time.

Exile
I am a free man.
My body is like a lord
My heart is like a criminal.
The ambition in my chest
I hung above the gate.
On a small island in a remote place
Even friends don't come
The fence is guarding me.
Cooking rice and doing laundry
Looking at that figure
Someone outside is washing pebbles.

Then one day I came to have a strong question.
'Who am I? How can I know this fact?' was the problem.

Then a thought flashed through my mind - the boundary of entering the body, that is, returning to the mind before one's body was formed.

One afternoon, I made an attempt for this, and the method was to remove one by one from my mind the thoughts I had acquired because of my body.
When I had removed all thoughts, I reached a world of nothing, and right there I saw one mind, and that mind was my root.

From then on, a great change occurred within me, and my mind came to see the world that only enlightened ones could see and the bodily events that only enlightened ones could experience.
The first thing I saw was that anguish and delusions disappeared from my head and emotions became dull - I didn't have the feeling of a living person even though I was alive, yet I wasn't dead either. Therefore I came to know that I was Tathagata.
From then on, my body rejected alcohol and meat, ceased to feel lust, and as greedy thoughts didn't arise, I forgot about thoughts of honor or material things.

Some time later, I went on a trip, and during the trip I experienced something very unpleasant from someone. But the anger that should naturally have arisen didn't occur, and instead I gained great joy. Seeing such things, I sang like this.

Everything in the world is a teacher.
Looking at each one
Meeting and parting also have teachings.
All things have grace and joy is in me
Blessing is like farming work
In keeping and practicing.

In spring 1985, one night, I came to receive messages transmitted through my heart from a very distant place twice. At that time my heart was filled with inexpressible emotion, and these words were heard from within my heart.

'Keep, practice, and give.'

'If you know the truth you will be lonely, if you speak the truth you will be cursed.'

If heaven hadn't transmitted these two messages to me, the work I'm doing now would have been too difficult. I left that island after staying on Yeonhwa Island for about 2 years to do the work I had to do.

Seeking truth from humans for the world was too difficult a task. When I obtained complete enlightenment and did the work of saving them, there was too great a wall between ordinary people and me.
I told my wife my truth. When I told her that I was enlightened and why I came to the world, she thought I had gone wrong and begged me to please not think about becoming Buddha and just play the role of a smart husband.
I revealed my truth to all the people close to me, but everyone who heard my words turned their backs on me.

I had worked hard for the past 3 years but hadn't met even one truthful person and had only driven away the people around me.
I had to see things many times a day that other humans couldn't experience, and heaven made me suffer too great trials regarding saving the world. I had to spend time seeing expectations, despair, and frustration endlessly appearing and disappearing within me.

I could expect no one's comfort except caring for myself, and seeing myself so lonely, I even had this expectation.
'If someone helps my work even a little, I will grant all their wishes.' I could promise, but no one believed my promise.

Occasionally there were those who spoke wishes, and when I met them, they wanted diseases that hospitals couldn't cure to be healed. I had the expectation that if I helped with even such things, they might have even a little interest in me, but they only got their illness cured and never came back to find me. No matter how much wisdom I squeezed out, transmitting truth to humans wasn't easy.

No matter whom I met, there was no one who wanted to know the truth and live properly. I who had never received humane treatment anywhere after obtaining enlightenment. Then how much humiliation and wandering must my life flounder in?

But I couldn't stop the work I was doing even for a moment. Because they were my only hope and all of my life.

====================

I heard about many things that happened in the past and present from him.

I remembered words I had said in a dream long ago.
"What kind of person are you looking for?"
When that monk asked, my answer was
"True and good..."
Looking at him, I came to know he was the person I was looking for.

That monk in the dream had trailed off saying there probably wasn't such a person in today's world, but I didn't give up and sought and waited and searched and now seemed to have met him.

I wanted to confirm his complete enlightenment.
'An enlightened one will recognize an enlightened one.'
I met him at a tea house.
"Teacher, I'll read this writing to you, so please tell me its meaning."
I knew that he knew nothing through books.
"While Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva was practicing to reach the highest enlightenment, he saw that the five aggregates were all empty and escaped from all suffering."
When I explained the Heart Sutra up to here, he immediately said.
"The one who said those words is also enlightened. Who is he?"

Tears welled up in me. If there were no people around, I felt the impulse and emotion to embrace his neck and cry.
I knew the time was near when I would have to completely take refuge in him.

But before that, I wanted to confirm once more in the world.

I asked him to travel together. I took him to visit several places. Places where people rumored to be enlightened lived, or where they resided.

He met them and saw those places and told me the truth within them.
They were all not enlightened, he said, and explained the reasons, which I understood. He carefully told me the truths of the words in the world and talked about the lives of saints.

During the trip, I came to understand him and the world more, so upon returning I immediately bowed three times to him and asked to become his disciple.

He finally had his first disciple 3 years after obtaining enlightenment.

He named me 'Soyeon,' and from then on we set out on the same path for the world as teacher and disciple.

The teacher blessed me with a poem.

Poem Dedicated to Soyeon
Soyeon
A flower that bloomed
In a lonely heart.
In the dew-wet heart
Is dawn coming?
For a bright world
Trying to bloom as one ray of light
I want to contain all my wisdom.
Even thinking of red roses
Even drawing white lilies
I wished for one small lotus
To bloom.
Soyeon
When you bloom lonely
For the world
When you agonize
For the world
Placing that one flower
That bloomed in great trials
I wished for Soyeon.

[*Publisher's note:* I have deep suspicions either about 1. the sameness of this poem to the copy that appears in Traveler - which I have assisted in translating many times; or 2. the actual correctness of this translation, especially the last line, as I recall that in other versions it seemed to say something about 'wishing to call the flower Soyeon' instead. Good example of why caution is highly warranted. Sometimes poems need to be prompted to LLMs to translate them differently. End publisher's note.]

The teacher explained his work.
"A saint is one who comes to sacrifice himself to awaken human ignorance."
"I am prepared."
"The path I walk is too far and lonely. Now that you've met me, wrong people won't follow you. When I obtained enlightenment and became right, the foolish world left me. I lived alone for 3 years in that lonely world. So you too should serve the world before obtaining enlightenment. Otherwise you won't see the good things of the world."
"I will serve the world. If I just know how to serve, I will devote myself."

We had to find and serve those seeking truth, but the path to finding such people was vague.

I moved my residence to a temple called Songnamwon near the teacher's home, and he came to find me every morning to teach the dharma.

About a month after I met him? One morning I discovered something round protruding in the middle of his forehead.

"Tathagata, what is that on your forehead?"

He touched his forehead and looked in the mirror.

The eye of the soul.

Who could believe such a thing? Buddha's eye that I had only seen in Buddhist art, the mark of completed wisdom had protruded on his forehead.

It appears once in thousands of years among humanity, so it's natural that people don't believe.

But I saw it. People see it too. But they don't believe. They're indifferent.

I struggled to find those who wanted to know the truth and lead them to the teacher. I informed all the people I knew of the teacher's existence.

'There is one who has achieved the highest enlightenment.' Most people who heard my gospel began to be wary of me from then on.

They showed disappointment in me and were afraid. I too, like the teacher, lost the people around me one by one.

I realized that thinking of myself as precious while doing this work brought great suffering.

I felt the need to lower myself as much as possible, and as a method of such practice, I began begging alms on the streets.
But even visiting one or two hundred houses a day, there was nowhere that welcomed me to come with an empty alms bowl.

A young lady gave me a 10-won coin.
"Um, miss, this is 10 won?"
The young lady glared at me and said,
"It should be one person, two people coming to beg."
She snapped at me.

I went to the neighborhood where the most rich families gathered in Busan. I walked around for an hour and a half but couldn't meet anyone because they wouldn't open their gates.
But when I rang the bell at one house, a woman's voice answered the intercom from inside.

"Who is it?"
"Yes. I'm a monk out for alms."
"I'm just preparing to go out. Please wait a moment."
The woman's voice was unexpectedly kind. I stretched my neck waiting expectantly for that woman to come out. After waiting perhaps more than 5 minutes, a heavily made-up woman finally came out and said,
"Oh my, monk. I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long."
She made a fuss and then placed a 100-won coin in my hand. I looked at that precious money for a long time.

When I stopped at a tailor shop, the owner gave me 500 won and said,
"Monk, don't you chant any prayers?"
So I chanted one with a sincere heart blessing that house.
Then another customer in the tailor shop asked the owner.
"Owner, did you burn incense in your house?"
"No."
"That's strange. Don't you smell incense?"
When I came back and told the teacher about this, the teacher also admired it and said,
"Such things can happen too."
He was pleased.

I went begging every day without fail for a month, so I wandered many places.
When I stopped at a tea house, a male customer showed great hostility toward me and insulted me.
"Look here. With such a good-looking face, what are you doing going around like this with nothing better to do?"
He pointed at the tea house register with his hand and said,
"That woman is several times better than you," and scolded me.
As I left the tea house, unable to bear it, I said to him,
"What you did to me today, you will surely see the results someday."
But I immediately regretted saying this.
'I should have endured.'

I tried hard to transmit the dharma that blesses human life whenever people showed even a little interest and asked, but people weren't interested.

Most Christians, when they saw me, simply said
"I believe."
and turned their faces away. Since monks leave without taking alms when they hear these words, even non-Christians often used this phrase.
When I stopped at a pharmacy, the owner said in a dignified voice,
"I believe."
and smiled. Since he sent a smile, I also smiled and said,
"I believe too."
He stared blankly.
"I believe in Jesus too. He was one of the most truthful people among humanity. If we don't believe in such a person, who would we believe?"
He stood still without words.

Begging practice wasn't easy after all. Not because I was seeking money, but because I was humbling my mind and trying to bless people, yet when I received disregard or contempt from others, I felt stressed.

Every day the teacher gave me strength and courage when I talked about what I heard and saw on the streets.
I collected all the money from begging and used it to spread the Buddhist dharma, so that merit would return even to those who gave 10 won.

In April 1988, the teacher went alone to Japan to find truthful people and spread the dharma.

He knew neither English nor Japanese, so it was difficult for him to handle immigration procedures alone. The first two days were wasted settling into lodging in central Osaka and learning the roads.
On the third day, he sat on the street with a lantern near Shitennoji Station in Osaka. Though he sat motionless on the road for several hours, no one was interested in his appearance or spoke to him.

In the end, the first to speak were Japanese police.
They chattered something, but when communication was completely impossible, they asked in sign language 'Do you have a passport?' 'Do you have money?' and so on.

The teacher showed them writing introducing himself in Japanese and pamphlets, and after reading them all, they only said he had to move.
The next day he sat near Osaka Main Station but was pushed away by station staff.
The teacher had to walk streets he didn't know with a lantern in one hand and a bag on one shoulder.

The teacher tried to find the Korean consulate to meet the cultural affairs consul but couldn't meet him even after several hours.
He tried to get help from Koreans, but they all demanded money for interpretation. The teacher didn't have enough money to buy an interpreter.

The teacher's expectation of transmitting the most precious path in human life for the world wasn't fulfilled anywhere.
In the end, the teacher returned to Korea after 17 days of hardship. The teacher said to me.

"I will overcome all the hypocrisy in the world. And I will find those with courage and hope and make the path of blessing with eternal life and peace available to people."

We sought methods again. We sent letters to ambassadors of 20 countries stationed in Korea. The teacher introduced himself as a natural scientist instead of an enlightened one and conveyed this content.

"I am a scientist who has researched natural phenomena. Through my own observation and research, I have obtained very beneficial information.
Specifically, I can explain the relationship between the mind humans possess and disease,
I can cure diseases individuals have,
And I can prove that using that mental power, I can also cure diseases in others' bodies.
I know very accurate information about problems humanity faces, and I can introduce new facts about how the secrets of life, death, and birth are connected through oneself.
Hoping that my work can help all people living in this era, I request the ambassador's consideration so that exchange can occur through discussion, research, and activities with our brothers in your country."

In reality, the teacher is the being who can provide the greatest help for everything humans desire. But humans didn't grant the teacher's earnest wish.

The response to about 20 letters came from only one place, the Swiss embassy. He only gave us the address of the 'Human Science Society' in Bern, Switzerland.
We sent a letter to the president at the address he gave us, but there was never a reply.
Our attempt was frustrated again.

The teacher instinctively hurried when morning dawned, forgetting yesterday's events while thinking about how important his work was.
But when he saw his own situation, everything went dark before his eyes, and he struggled to forget himself again.

The teacher said to me.

"Humans fear being broken. But saints don't think about being broken."

The teacher returned broken wherever he went.

"I am one who tries to break rocks with eggs. Therefore I don't expect my work to succeed easily. But I will surprise the world. If I can awaken even one human by being broken thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of times, that should be seen as success."

I knew the teacher's situation, so I gave him most of my income.
But my income was only about 100,000 won per month, so when two people worked with that money, it was equally poor.
But when the teacher said he needed to travel, I worried about expenses first.

Seeing me like that, the teacher said,

"I don't want to travel for our own business. Then why worry about expenses? Worry about how much we can help the world."

One day, a man was praying in the main hall of the temple where I stayed. Looking at his complexion, he was almost dying.

I wanted to help with his difficulties, so I said,
"Layman, please come see me after you finish praying."
Then he came to my room.

When I served him tea, he was so grateful.
Since he was now drowning and would grasp at straws, my kindness must have been like meeting Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

He said right away.
"Monk, please save me."

"I'll save you. If you do as I say."
Of course he said he would do as told. He was withering under tremendous external energy pressure. I went to the teacher, informed him of this fact, and asked if he would help him.

"Don't make such requests of me. But if there's no one to solve it, I'll help. All disasters come from one's own mistakes. But when one doesn't realize their mistakes and someone else solves it for them, it becomes the law of cause and effect that they create even greater misfortune."

Ghosts were rampant around him. Though he went to shamans and temples to drive away ghosts, he couldn't solve his problem at all, and his whole house was covered in dark shadows.
I made him pray for 15 days and guided him to have enlightenment in his mind. He diligently completed 2 weeks and pestered me using my promise to help as an excuse.

I told the couple.
"If you receive the teacher's grace and deny it saying it never happened, you will see tremendous suffering both alive and dead. Is that okay?"
They seemed scared by those words and hesitated for a few days, but when the situation became urgent, they said they would listen to anything.
The teacher visited his house and dispelled the bad energy. When the problem was solved, he never came back.
He forgot our request to learn the dharma, build merit by transmitting it to others, and his own promise, and was busy making money with his healthy body.

People are generous to those who deceive them but stingy to those who don't deceive.
When looking at people and worldly affairs, the loneliness of having to speak truth in a world where truth doesn't work became even more acute.

Time was passing rapidly and our work was spinning in place. What was urgent was the world's business, but the world was deeply asleep.

Life is good by achieving truth while alive, death is good by escaping from toil.
I asked the teacher.

"I have a place to reach and now I clearly know that path and have begun walking. If I had to die now, I would dislike it and want to live more."

The teacher said.

"Don't think you're alive. Don't think about dying either. Only think about becoming true. Don't think about helping anyone. Don't expect anything from anyone. Without expectations there's no disappointment. Just do your best."

The teacher gathered the writings he wanted to leave after seeing his heart during that time and gave them to me.

"These writings will become very valuable someday. So I want to give them to you."

The writings were conscience and courage that overcame himself in the world, love and anguish dedicated to humans fallen into despair, and the mission of having to speak truth among people without truth.

I wanted to organize the writings I received from the teacher and what I had written down of the teacher's teachings into a manuscript to make a book and distribute it to people, but I had no money.

One day when one of my middle school classmates visited, I showed him the manuscript, and he said he would donate the cost of publishing the book.

We made 1,000 copies. The title was 'Wanderer.'

But even as a book, the teacher's writing was a wanderer with nowhere to go. Since there was no one to take the book, 'Wanderer' had to be buried in the attic.

We planned another foreign pilgrimage. Of course we were penniless, but the teacher just said we would go in December. One day a relative I hadn't heard from in years visited.

I told her about my work. She donated several million won some time later.

"Please do some worldly work on my behalf, monk."

On December 13, 1988, relying on my short English skills, we boarded a plane to Thailand. The plane arrived at Bangkok airport after midnight. We rented 2 rooms on a monthly contract at a cheap inn called A.A House. From the day after arrival, I went out looking for people.

I asked the inn guide where the biggest temple in Bangkok was, and they pointed me to Wat Phra Kaew.
It was known as the Emerald Temple. The entrance fee was 3,000 won.
I approached the ticket inspector and asked if I could enter free since I was a monk from Korea, but he coldly refused.
I had no choice but to pay and enter, but I couldn't see even one monk. When I asked where all the monks were, they said it wasn't a place of practice. I walked around for an hour regretting the money I paid, but I had no interest at all in touring the glittering temple.

On the 17th, I visited Thailand's First Royal Teacher Phra Nyanasamvara. I revealed that I had come with an enlightened teacher and showed him the letter the teacher had sent to ambassadors as reference.

He read it slowly then asked if he could copy and keep one.
He promised to meet us at 3:30 PM on the 23rd.
On the 23rd, at the promised time we went to Wat Bowonniwet.
They were preparing politely to receive guests.
Three Western monks were waiting, and soon the royal teacher entered.

The teacher spoke first.
"The world consists of meaning. Everything that exists in this world arises and disappears within meaning."
The teacher's sermon continued.
Eventually the royal teacher asked.
"Is your teaching different from or the same as Shakyamuni's teaching?"
The teacher answered.
"If he is enlightened and I am enlightened, we see the same thing."
The teacher asked the royal teacher again.
"What do you teach?"
"I teach precepts, scriptures, and meditation."
"It is extremely difficult for an enlightened one to break precepts. It is also extremely difficult for an unenlightened one to keep precepts. The world exists within scriptures, so it is also difficult for the blind to see it. What kind of meditation do you do?"
One monk took a meditation pose and the teacher followed it. The teacher soon released the posture and spoke.
"One cannot reach complete peace through this method."
The teacher's argument was firm.
More than an hour passed and the teacher's words continued one-sidedly. A Western monk asked.
"Do you think you are the highest teacher?"
"Yes. Two awakened ones don't appear in one era. One who has reached complete enlightenment appears in the world once every three thousand or five thousand years."
They listened silently.
The royal teacher asked the teacher.
"Then what is your teaching?"
"I teach conscience and justice."
The royal teacher was satisfied. The teacher asked again.
"What is the foundation of the world that exists in human teachings?"
The royal teacher asked back.
"What is your answer?"
"Morality."
When the royal teacher heard my interpretation, a disappointed smile crossed his face. He seemed to understand the word morality as something like Confucius's moral. I quickly corrected my interpretation.
"What he means is truth and reality."
The teacher spoke again.
"You are with me now but don't see me. Shakyamuni Buddha prophesied that a truthful one would appear in this era to make Buddha's path exist again,
Jesus also said a truthful one would appear in this era to save the world.
Hindus in India put red dots on their foreheads, meaning one with a third eye will appear in this era to save them.
This is called the eye of wisdom or Buddha's eye, and because one with this eye actually appears about once every three thousand years, it's difficult for people to recognize. Look at my forehead."
The royal teacher looked carefully at the teacher's forehead and then asked.
"May I touch it?"
When the teacher permitted, he walked up to the teacher and touched the round bead-shaped eye of wisdom protruding from the teacher's forehead.
The royal teacher quietly returned to his chair and shook his head.
"No one believes."
The teacher spoke about the special abilities he had.
The royal teacher asked for the phone number of our lodging.
As time had passed, the teacher finally asked the royal teacher.
"Do you have a wish?"
He said nothing. We exchanged greetings to conclude the meeting.
"I also teach like you."
The teacher finally greatly awakened him.
"You listen and teach, I see and teach. This is the difference between you and me."
The royal teacher greeted the teacher.
"I am very happy to have met you."
I was moved by the teacher's dignified appearance teaching the royal teacher.
Because these were words and actions that only one who had reached the highest enlightenment could make.

On December 22, we visited Chulalongkorn, Thailand's top university, and met the president.
I identified myself as Korean monk Soyeon.
I said I had come looking for truthful people. Please introduce me to such people.
The president humbly said.

"I am not yet such a person. But there is someone I can introduce. I will guide you to that person."

The place we were guided to by staff was Dhamma Satan, a truth hall on campus,
and the person I met was Director Dr. Rawi.
I asked him if I wanted to hold a lecture here, and he readily agreed.
We decided on the title 'Buddha's Path,' and they said they would do the publicity.

I went around chasing connections wherever they led, searching for connections alone.
We bought pots and pans and cooked rice to eat.
The teacher went to the market every day.
He took the bus to the big produce market and bought one head of cabbage, mushrooms, and bananas.
He only bought the cheapest foods with the most quantity at the market.
The cheapest were cabbage and mushrooms.
We ate cabbage every single day for a month without fail.
Cabbage soup, stir-fried cabbage, cabbage wraps, cabbage salad.
We used money as sparingly as salt.

We needed someone to interpret Thai for the sermon at the truth hall.
We looked for someone through the Korean association.
It was a Korean in graduate school who demanded 70,000 won for 3 hours of interpretation.
In Thailand, a professor's monthly salary was about 150,000-160,000 won.
We gave up using an interpreter. Not just because of money, but we couldn't transmit truth through the mouth of someone with such conscience.

The next day, I visited Chonburi Temple, a large temple in the Bangkok suburbs again.
When I looked for the greatest teacher there, they said he was out. When I looked for the next most respected teacher, not only could we not communicate because he didn't speak English, but seeing I was a nun, he waved his hand with an annoyed expression. Seeing his appearance, I lost any thought of meeting him.
In Thailand, the status of nuns was very low. Nuns couldn't even wear yellow robes.
This wasn't the teaching of an enlightened one but the prejudice of unenlightened ones.

I asked the monk guiding me.
"Please take me to a monk who speaks English well."

He took me for quite a while then had me wait in front of a large hall. About 200 monks were listening to a lecture in the classroom. They glanced at me standing outside the window.
Shortly after, the lecturer who had just been teaching stopped his lecture and came out directly. He welcomed me warmly with an innocent face. I stated my business.

"I came to Bangkok with my teacher. I'd like to hold a dharma meeting at this temple once."
He went back into the office and soon came back with a schedule.
"Do you know anyone in Bangkok?"
He asked kindly.
"No one."
"A guide?"
"None."
Perhaps feeling sorry for me, he introduced two Thais.
One was Mrs. Pilaivan and one was Dr. Supang.
Mrs. Pilaivan lived close to A.A House. Her house was very large and wealthy, she was an educated woman who graduated from Chulalongkorn University and was working in publishing. Since she lived with an English husband, her English was very fluent.

When I asked her to interpret at the truth hall and Chonburi Temple, she readily agreed. Though it would be double interpretation, I was relieved. The teacher would speak in Korean, I would translate to English, and Mrs. Pilaivan would interpret to Thai.

I also met Dr. Supang at Chulalongkorn University.
Dr. Supang bought five or six side dishes from a Chinese restaurant for me and brought them in a bag. We took them to the campus cafeteria and had lunch.
She had come to Korea several times to attend Buddhist seminars for her major and had her own books about Buddhism and meditation.
She said she would attend the truth hall lecture with her friend. She was active and uninhibited, and was quite a well-known woman.

The next day, Pilaivan drove to pick us up. Dr. Supang who had promised to come yesterday never showed up. After I introduced the teacher to people, I read the prepared message.

"Dear brothers.
I am traveling to find humanity's path, and I have come here to awaken the dark hearts of humans. I can speak neither English nor Thai, but I will do my best for this mission.
Today all humanity is in great danger, and such crises existed in the past and will exist again in the future.
But don't be afraid. This phenomenon exists for a better world, it's just how the world is meant to be. Therefore if you give up on the world, you yourselves will also perish. The choice is yours and your decision will also be respected.
Miracles will not happen in any case. If miracles happen, they are only the result of your ceaseless efforts.
I will tell you the purpose of my visit. I want to awaken and break your illusory words and foolish lives. I demand that you save yourselves in the factual world. I want to ask you one thing.
'What are you doing now?'
If you can see results, can you know what influence your present will have on your future? You know nothing about such things. And you must also see the results of the future that exist in the present.
I want to help with this. This meeting is precious for you and for me. The reason truthful people are rare in today's world is because truth no longer flows in this world, and the reason truth doesn't work is because people's truth is precious.
If there is someone who truly loves themselves, it will be possible for them to know themselves. Those who realize who they are can also see the past and future.
The ignorant will perish, those who know facts will save themselves.
If you want to obtain that path, wake up. If you want to walk that path, make effort.
If you want to obtain truth, you must first know the dharma.
Now I will tell you the true meaning of Buddha.
The blind only doubt the world, they don't realize their own darkness.
How can Buddha exist in such a world?
Heaven produces Buddha to make this world exist.
The world creates Buddha's path so people know heaven's will.
Obtaining one means obtaining another - that is meaning.
If you don't see me, how can I teach you?
Buddha's path existed in the past and will exist in the future.
I will tell you one more fact, and if you can hear it, you will be able to obtain the world and eternal life.
How does one human complete themselves?
Shakyamuni Buddha went to people after completing himself. People asked how he obtained complete enlightenment. Then he answered.
'I have served the foundation of humanity for countless ages.'
Therefore you must believe the Tathagata's words, ask what the foundation of good is, and realize it. Then Buddha's path will open before you.
If you want to hear Buddha's world from me, it's useless. Despite completely understanding that world, I'm talking through Shakyamuni Buddha's experience, not my own experience.
The reason is that although no one can know Buddha's mind now, many speak as if they know it. But you can never see his mind before becoming Buddha.
The Tathagata also used the word 'liberation.' It means he saw him in Buddha's world.
What the Tathagata taught was the law of cause and effect. His truth could illuminate the world. Since he had to tell someone the dharma, he couldn't stay long in one place. He wandered the whole country looking for truthful hearts.
Buddha doesn't know the world of the blind (sentient beings) and sentient beings also don't know Buddha's world. So Buddha continued traveling to meet people who understood his words.
His efforts made Buddha's path exist in this world again.
Because people don't know the law of cause and effect, they can't see the reality of the world clearly open before their eyes. Because they lack truthfulness.
The Tathagata pleaded not to ruin yourselves. The core parts of the scriptures also show the results of sins arising from human ignorance. If you know the law of causality, saving yourself is very easy. If not, you will easily abandon yourself.
I want to teach two things.
Serve yourself.
And serve the world.
If you can learn this, you will obtain eternal life and paradise.
The more important thing is to spread this fact.
Now I will prove my truth. Ask anything. You will hear the most accurate answers.
Just as I came looking for you, you will know that I am never a stranger to you. Through this, Buddha's path will exist eternally in the world."

Dr. Rawi said.
"We are trying to live according to Buddha's teachings."
The teacher asked.
"What are Buddha's teachings that you know?"
Dr. Rawi explained the Four Noble Truths. The teacher said.
"You know so little that it's difficult to teach."
"How do you know whether we know something or not?"
The teacher laughed heartily.
"There is a way to know. I'll ask you one of the easiest things here. May I ask?"
They said nothing. The teacher asked briefly.
"Where does dharma exist?"
The truth hall was silent as if water had been poured over it. The silence was frustrating, so a female student answered.
"It exists in the mind."
"People who learned wrongly always say that."
The teacher spoke much truth about the meaning of life, how to cultivate life, changes in the world, and humanity's future. Though the audience wasn't large, everyone was serious.

In the car returning, Pilaivan encouraged me.
"Your teaching is excellent. You are swimming upstream. I believe in you."
When I first met her, she had welcomed me with strict courtesy toward monks.
When the conversation deepened a bit, she said this.
"Here too, only yellow robes are fluttering."
The teacher mentioned humans' external truth and internal truth in the car. He was talking about Pilaivan and Dr. Supang.
Though it was December, Bangkok's weather was sweltering. Pilaivan continuously wiped sweat.

The next day, we drove for over an hour to arrive at Chonburi Temple. When Pilaivan saw the monks, she immediately prostrated three times. In that scene I saw Thailand, the Buddhist kingdom.

Many monks were already waiting for us in the hall. The hall was packed inside and many monks were seated outside too. Lecturer monk Panya welcomed us.

When I introduced the teacher, he was quite surprised. Because a middle-aged man was standing there. He had thought the teacher would naturally be a monk.

With a very embarrassed look, he went back into the hall and explained the situation to people. Whether he got the monks' understanding, he soon guided us into the hall. It must have been unprecedented for their tradition. An ordinary man standing at the dharma seat with monks listening.

"I have reached complete enlightenment. If there's something you want to know, ask."

The teacher's existence is a reflecting mirror. If nothing is shown before the mirror, it is empty. Only when problems are presented do answers appear in the mirror.
Enlightenment. It is the answer. Through him, people can hear all the truth they want. But it's difficult for people to recognize his existence and difficult to understand his words.
When he lived, they were indifferent to him. They miss him. And only after he dies is he treated like a god as years pass.
Humans have always repeated such foolish things.

A monk asked.
"How did you obtain enlightenment?"
"Watermelons just grew from watermelon plants. I was already an enlightened person in my previous life."
"What did you do before enlightenment?"
"I loved my country and compatriots with my conscience and courage."
"If we can't obtain enlightenment through scriptures or prayer, what should we do?"
"Follow and learn from me. You will change.
Stay by my side for 1 year, see what I do and hear my words. Then all the wrong perceptions within you will disappear.
After 2 years, you will awaken to right and wrong. And after 3 years you will gain courage. After that, you can finally do the work of love for yourself and the world."

The monks didn't understand the teacher's teaching well. Their listening attitude was scattered as if thinking 'is that all?' The teacher asked them.
"If anyone among you has hope and courage, stand up."
No one stood up.
The teacher's words are ordinary. All truth exists in the ordinary. But no one in the world except him can speak those ordinary words.
A monk brought a picture and asked what it meant. Some shapes were drawn on the paper.
"If an enlightened one drew this, I can know. But if an unenlightened one drew it, it's their mind so I cannot know."
The shape drawing seemed to represent the world, soul's reincarnation, and dimensional worlds.

On the way back, I asked Pilaivan to stop at a department store. I wanted to give even a small gift thanking her for her courage and effort. Noticing, she took us straight to our lodging. She said.

"I also love my country and nation. You came all the way here doing this difficult work. How can you talk about compensation for me?"

Her words were comfort and encouragement to us who were lonely.

One day, 2 young monks attending monk college visited.
They were Phracha Waikru and Chorivit living at Benchamabophit, the marble temple, the most beautiful temple. They stood at the entrance sweating profusely with lots of fruit and cake.

They smiled unnaturally, seeming a bit awkward visiting a nun's lodging. I talked to them about the essence of Buddhism and monastic life.

Phracha looked at me with respectful eyes and said.
"You seem like a monk at a high level. I think I have much to learn."
I gave them the book 'Wanderer' as a gift and explained the contents in English, and they listened with interest.

Knowing they had come, the teacher came down to my room.
I introduced the teacher to them and said he was enlightened so ask anything.
They were at a loss with nothing to ask.
Generally, people cannot ask questions. Since they know nothing, they have nothing to ask.

When I kept urging, Phracha took his wallet out of his bag.
"What is in this wallet?"
"Are you asking me to see what's in that wallet?"
"Yes."
"Then bring that wallet here. I need to see inside."

There is an important teaching in this anecdote.
An enlightened one cannot see what's behind a wall.
Enlightenment. It means seeing the world of laws that exist in the world. He sees a fact and sees the principle within it. Seeing the cause he knows the result, seeing the result he knows the cause. He is versed in paths. An enlightened one is one who sees dharma with a truthful heart.

For someone with a destination, the most precious thing is the path. So we look for those with hope and courage.
Those who want to see the best through life, and those with courage to do that work to the end.
There's nothing as difficult as changing oneself. But those who want a better self must change their wrong parts. Even changing one small daily habit isn't easy.
Changing one's foundation is changing one's fate. And that's only possible through enlightenment.
Meeting an enlightened one is like the most blessed meeting in the world.

Meeting him accomplishes everything about oneself. Not because he accomplishes it, but because he teaches how to accomplish. However, the teacher will only teach what benefits him.
People seek all kinds of things before Buddha statues that neither hear nor see. Speak your wishes before a living Buddha.
He will teach the path and you must make effort. Just as farmers obtain fruit through sincerity and effort, blessing is like farming. It must be kept and practiced.

Someone asked me a question similar to what Phracha did.
He was a quite famous missionary in Korea. He said he hadn't yet met anyone he could call a master.
He said there was no great monk who knew whether the person passing outside the door was male or female.

I said to him.
"Ask me that question." He asked that question as I told him.
"Monk, someone just passed outside the door. Male or female?"
I answered.
"Stand up and open the window."
Koreans often tell this story.
A great monk woke up in the morning and without going outside said to his disciple.
"Child, Mrs. So-and-so is coming up the mountain carrying rice. Go down and receive it."
When he went down, indeed that woman was coming up carrying rice.
Then they say that monk has high enlightenment. To be clear, such things have nothing to do with true enlightenment. People in today's world have lost the path of enlightenment.
In fact, no one knows what enlightenment is, what kind of life enlightened people live, how enlightenment comes, while only the words of those who don't know run rampant.

During our time in Thailand, we wandered many places as far as our feet could reach, but we didn't meet the people we were looking for.

On January 13, 1989, we departed for Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.
The plane was delayed, and while waiting at the airport for 7 hours and 30 minutes, we met young Koreans returning from climbing the Himalayas.
Several of them had severely frostbitten fingers that needed to be amputated.
A current teacher named Mr. Jin earnestly urged us to be careful with drinking water. He said he started having diarrhea immediately after drinking a few sips of water and suffered for days with no medicine working.
And he said to pay only 40 rupees for taxi fare when landing at Kathmandu airport. I checked the situation there by asking various things to a Nepali sitting next to me on the plane.
When we landed at the airport, several taxi drivers rushed us, making a fuss to take their cars.
They asked for 120 rupees, 100 rupees, 70 rupees, all different.
I cut it to 15 rupees. At first they all turned away as if that was ridiculous. Since I had heard stories, I held out to the end.
When most customers had left, one driver came to me and okayed 15 rupees.
I told the driver.
"Take us to a cheap, quiet, clean hotel."
After negotiating the room rate, writing the accommodation card, and going to the room, there was no lock on the inside of the door. There was a doorknob lock but that wasn't reliable. We couldn't use that room without a sturdy latch that could be locked from inside. We had no choice but to leave that place.

Night was deep and I was so tired I thought one night would be fine, but the teacher wouldn't tolerate even one night. The teacher's thoroughness was incomparable. He always emphasized "nothing beats sturdy."
The employee lied saying "All Kathmandu hotels are like this" trying to keep us, but it was useless.

The teacher dragged the heavy bag and I carried my pack walking the unfamiliar dark night road.
After walking for a while, a taxi passed. We finally unpacked at Gaju, a third-class hotel in Thamel.

January in Kathmandu was quite cold. The cheap hotel had no heating at all. I had to shiver all night under one blanket.
When day broke, flocks of crows covered the roofs black and cawed noisily. It was dreary. The magnolia blooming in the hotel yard briefly reminded me of Korea.

There was a small restaurant in the hotel that also sold Chinese food. You could eat your fill for about 500 won, which was good. Since water was free, we always drank only water. We almost never even had the expense of drinking 100-won tea after meals.

We brought the electric rice cooker we used in Thailand, but we didn't feel the need to cook here, so we decided to sell the rice cooker.
We sold for 4,000 won what we had bought in Thailand for 4,000 won.

After I sold the rice cooker and returned, the teacher said to me.
"Hey, you're scary."
Since electronics were precious there, even used goods were very popular.

From the day after arriving in Kathmandu, I went looking for monasteries.
I went to Boudhanath Stupa, said to be the largest, and met several Nepali lama monks and a French lama monk. The French monk had been there about 5 years and was translating scriptures into French.

When I said,
"You can't even understand the scriptures, how can you translate them?"
He smiled and said.
"I try."

I introduced the teacher and told him our hotel, and he promised to visit the next day. But he didn't appear the next day.

I always carefully observed people's faces. I was someone seeking people, and everyone was my target.
In the morning at Rose Garden restaurant, I met a Polish woman, Miss Ides. She was 36, still unmarried, and said she studied Buddhism. When I asked what Buddhism she studied, she said scriptures and meditation.
I told her about the mistakes in that, but she stated her conclusion.
"I will go my path. I don't wait for a teacher."

The blind walk the path in their thoughts. But the path in their thoughts and the path that exists in the world are always different. People always say.
'Things don't go as planned in the world.'
That makes some sense. There is hope in my heart and there is a path in the world.
If you intend to go to Seoul, know the path to Seoul and go to Seoul. Then your intention will be fulfilled. For those with true hope in this world, the path will be desperately needed.

If the blind can't see ahead and don't know the path, arriving at the destination is impossible. Right. Most people are already accustomed to their path no matter how painful. Tree branches keep trying to extend only eastward. Changing fate requires enlightenment and courage.

On the morning of January 16, I met Miss Malta, an American divorcee, at Mona Lisa restaurant.
She said she came to Nepal planning to volunteer at an orphanage in Pokhara. She said Mother Teresa's sister was the director of that orphanage.
We took a taxi with her to Kopan Monastery. We heard there was an excellent monk there.

It was quite far and we paid 400 rupees for the round-trip taxi fare. There was no elder monk, and a young lama monk welcomed us, who seemed to be the general affairs manager there. He was busy directing construction work and commanding other monks.
While drinking tea, the teacher spoke his teaching.
He listened quietly well. Since his listening attitude was good,
"Won't you visit our hotel?" I asked, but
he said he couldn't go because he was busy. The teacher laughed and replied.
"Is there work busier than saving yourself?"
The next day I visited Khenchen Trangu Rinpoche again. On his door was a leaflet saying he would hold a Buddhist seminar at Oxford University in England for a month.
I asked him.
"A teacher has come. Would you like to meet him?"
He agreed.
I brought in the teacher who was waiting outside. The teacher asked him right away.
"Do you want to become a leader or a beggar?"
He seemed slightly shocked then answered.
"I'm fine as I am."
"Fisherman Peter became the first Pope because he met Jesus. Do you think you're inferior to Peter?"
"I don't know Peter well."
"If you know something, tell me one thing, and if you want to know something, ask."
He was silent.
"If you neither know anything nor want to know anything, we have no reason to sit here longer.
Soyeon, let's go."
The teacher immediately stood up.

What I met at Kathmandu's stupas and monasteries was filth and poverty, illusion and ignorance. It was difficult to find the true appearance of Buddhism there.

The teacher spent difficult days. In fact, he didn't even properly know the English alphabet.
Moreover, being unable to read or hear the writing or speech of that foreign country, and unable to comfortably converse with people, I don't know how frustrated he must have been.

While I searched around knocking on doors looking for complete strangers, stress accumulated heavily in my heart too.

One morning, the teacher and I fought over something trivial.
My hair clippers broke so I hadn't cut my hair for about 3 weeks. I went early in the morning to get a razor from the teacher to shave my head. The teacher somehow disliked seeing me shave my head clean with a razor. He said my face looked pale. When I insisted on shaving my head with a razor since there were no clippers, the teacher scolded me.

I shouted, "Are you even interfering with cutting my hair?" and threw a tantrum.
The stress I had received exploded using that incident as an excuse.
The teacher didn't just leave me throwing a tantrum.
He took out all the money, divided it, and said let's have separate journeys.
I stubbornly reached out my hand to receive that money.
But the next moment I turned and fell on the bed crying.

It was lonely and difficult worldly work. The teacher went outside upset, and I lay on the bed exhausted. After about two hours, the teacher came in urgently.

"Soyeon, a guest is coming. Get up quickly."
The guest was already standing at the door. He was a Tibetan lama monk who looked over forty.
I asked how he brought this person here.
"After fighting with you, I felt bad so I just walked around, and this person caught my eye. His impression looked decent so I approached him. When I called 'Hello,' he looked. So I did like you do, 'Can you speak English?' and he immediately said 'Yes.' Then I was at a loss for words."

From then the teacher used hand and foot gestures, mobilizing all the words he had heard.
'Let's go. My hotel. You same same shaved head. Korean Buddhist. English very good.'
Listening to the teacher's story, I was holding my stomach laughing and that lama monk was also laughing.

"I could understand what you meant."
The teacher gave Lama Sonam sermons for over 3 hours.
He listened very carefully and occasionally asked questions.
"I also want to go to Korea and learn from you."
He expressed his intention.
The teacher of course permitted on the spot and said let's go to Korea together this time.
"I'll go around April. Because I have sermon appointments in several European countries until April."
The teacher asked.
"What on earth do you teach?"
"I teach meditation and the law of cause and effect."
The teacher laughed heartily.
"Tell me just one law you know."
Lama Sonam was speechless.
"You don't know the law. You can't teach the law. If you really want to teach, it's not too late to learn from one who knows and then teach."
Sonam nodded. He boasted that he had practiced orthodox Tibetan yoga for 3 years, which was very strict and arduous.
And he had been a monk for over ten years, and all three brothers were lama monks.

To Sonam who was delaying going together using lectures as an excuse, I tried to awaken him with an anecdote about Jesus.
When Jesus was also looking for people like me, he met a young man who understood a bit. When Jesus said let's go together, the young man was in mourning for his father, so naturally said this.
"I'll go after holding my father's funeral."
Jesus said.
"Let's go now. Leave the dead to the dead."
It's the same. I strongly told him.
"Lama Sonam, let's go now. If you're a seeker, when you meet an enlightened teacher, you must immediately follow him. If you distance yourself from us, your mind will fall asleep again and this matter will become distant from your heart."

He seemed unable to decide easily.
It was lunchtime. We took him to a restaurant and ordered lunch.
He ordered soup and beef steak, and we ordered vegetable fried rice.
After eating about half the steak, he said it was too tough to eat and ordered meat dumplings again.

The teacher and I looked at each other silently. We always ate only water and rice. We never even thought of soup and omitted tea. He ate alone in one meal what the two of us spent on food for 3 meals.

The teacher told Sonam.
"It's not good for a monk to eat a lot of meat. The energy of animals will make your energy turbid."
Lama Sonam sent several letters to Korea to me, but reading his intention of wanting things other than dharma to come to us, I lost interest. Though I tried to awaken him several times through letters, his ears were very dark.

That evening the teacher took me saying there was a barber he had seen during the day.
Kathmandu was dark once the sun set. There were almost no street lights. After going for a while through pitch-dark alleys, we stood in front of a small shop.
The moment I looked inside, I said I'd go back. It was too dirty.
The teacher held me and forcibly sat me in a chair. It was facilities that couldn't even compare to the barbershop I saw in the countryside when I was 7. Dirty towels, combs, scissors.
I just closed my eyes tightly and sat with a grimace with a black gown around my neck.
The teacher kept giggling seeing my appearance, finding it funny.
The haircut was completely manual.
He cut with scissors and kept wiping my face with that dirty towel. But because that barber cut my hair with such care, I gradually felt better and even got sleepy in the middle.
In fact, it was the first time since becoming a monk that a man's hands had touched my head so carefully.
When the haircut was finished, I even felt regret.
'If I go to Kathmandu again someday, I should go there and get my hair cut once more.'

The next afternoon, the teacher rushed into my room out of breath.
"Soyeon, let's go quickly."
"What's the matter?"
The teacher urged frantically. The teacher walked almost running and I ran.
The teacher's stride was more than one and a half times mine, so I always had to run behind the teacher with quick steps.
The place we arrived at after walking for 10 minutes was a small restaurant.
Two lama nuns were sitting. One was Swedish, one was Canadian, and they said they were going to the Dalai Lama.

The teacher asked them.
"What did you seek in becoming monks?"
They also responded with clichéd answers. The teacher felt very sorry for monks, especially those who shaved their heads and came to foreign countries to learn. What would they learn where there's no teacher? They would only waste their lives.

The teacher pleaded with them.
"Stay here with Soyeon for just one or two days. I'll pay for the hotel and meals. If you spend just two days with this Korean nun, you'll learn amazing things."
The teacher poured out his whole heart urging them earnestly. They looked at each other and laughed as if feeling sorry.
"We have to leave for India at 5 PM. Our tickets are reserved."
The teacher paid for their food and we returned to the hotel dejectedly.

"Soyeon, go up to your room first. I'll sit in the yard for a bit."
The teacher's voice was subdued.

I went up to my room on the 3rd floor and looked out the window.

I could see the teacher's back. His face was turned toward the distant sky. That figure was desolate.

I burst into tears with my forehead against the window. Heaven knows and earth knows, but only people's hearts don't know him.

Buddha Who Came to the World
A pure heart is like a mirror
The five desires left the body and departed.
The world is like a picture in a dream
There are no friends on heaven and earth.

Buddha who came to the world carrying brilliantly shining treasure has nowhere to go and nowhere to stay.
Is there anyone who wants the treasure Buddha has! Where are they?
Though he wanders the world looking for the owner of that treasure as soon as day breaks, no one seeks it or waits for it.
He staggers alone carrying the treasure of the world, heavy.
Who will lighten Buddha's burden! Who will become Buddha's owner!
Heaven. Today let me find righteous people.
Let them make a new world exist.
The awakened one sees the world's future and worries like a mountain, but the world's actual owners are fallen into deep, deep sleep.
Buddha. For whom must he live such a life of anguish?

My face was wet with tears and shadows were settling on the teacher's shoulders.

After staying ten days in Kathmandu, we headed for India.
The bus departing at 7 PM was scheduled to arrive at Suratani on the Nepal-India border at 6 AM the next day.

While waiting for the bus to depart, a pickpocket was already attached to me. A man sat leaning his buttocks on my seat armrest. I thought nothing of it and was looking out the window when I felt strange and looked forward - the zipper of my handbag was half open.

I looked up at him and shouted.
"What are you doing here?"
He quietly stood up and got off the bus. Fortunately nothing was taken out. There were many foreigners on the bus. I shouted to people to watch out for pickpockets. And I informed the ticket inspector of the facts.

The inside of the bus was dark, cold, and unpleasant. Since there was nowhere to load travelers' bags inside the bus, everything was loaded on the roof.
The teacher was very anxious about this and seemed not to sleep at all that night, jumping outside to watch the luggage every time the bus stopped. The teacher seemed not to sleep a wink all night worrying about the luggage.

The next morning, we got off at Suratani in the freezing fog. We waited 2 more hours sitting on wooden chairs under oil lamps before processing Nepal departure at 8 o'clock.
Next was time to process India entry. The official examining our passports looked for visas. We hadn't received visas. Something ridiculous happened.

When receiving foreign traveler education in Korea, we received a traveler's handbook issued by the government, which clearly stated India was no-visa for stays within 3 months.

The teacher took out that handbook and shouted urgently in Korean.
"This is a handbook issued by the Korean government. India entry is clearly stated as no-visa."
I interpreted but it was useless.
When we shouted, they also got angry.

When asked 'Isn't there something we can do?' there was only 'No.'

Actually, we were traveling with directly confirming everything as top priority.
But it was really strange. Both the teacher and I had completely forgotten about India visa matters.

Thinking about it now, not entering India then was heaven's help.

We turned back right there.
We canceled Nepal departure and headed back to Kathmandu.
There happened to be a bus shouting it was going to Kathmandu and departing.
There were 2 seats left in the very back, so we got on that bus.

That day we rode the bus back for another 14 hours. The bus bounced so much that I hit my head on the bus ceiling several times and my back hurt badly.
For several hours the bus endlessly wound along valleys.
We didn't know last night, but seeing in daylight, it was a very rough road. On the way back, we witnessed two crashes and collision accidents.

Neither the teacher nor I spoke any complaints.

We had been tormented on buses continuously for over 25 hours and had almost starved for a whole day.
When we arrived back at Hotel Gaju near midnight, the employees were puzzled but happy.

In the end, we gave up the India trip.

Thus the journey to find pure hearts that might be in Nepal ended.

We stepped on our homeland again after exactly one month and fifteen days.

We immediately deposited the remaining money in the bank for the next trip, and only 20,000 won remained in my hand.

Since I had also left Songnamwon, I temporarily stayed with relatives.

And a month later, I obtained a place to transmit dharma with the help of a merit-maker.

**Opening of Enlightenment House Dalma-won**

On March 5, 1989, Dalma-won (House of Enlightenment) opened.

The teacher told the bodhisattvas and good spirits in heaven above and below to dedicate their merit and grace to this work.

He said Buddha's path would open again here and all of heaven's energy would gather here.
