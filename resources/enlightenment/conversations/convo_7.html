<p>Tathagatha: Are you Hindu Shankaracharya?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: I have lots of things to know about you. Would you mind if I
ask you?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: Of course not.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What does Hinduism teach about?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: Itâ€™s about what god says.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What did the god say?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: The god taught everything.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Then, does the god teach necessary things in everything for
human life?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: Of course.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What are they then?</p>

<p>Shankaracharya: If you learn here, you will know everything.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: First of all, I want to identify one thing. What do you think
happiness is? And tell me what teaching I should follow in order to gain
happiness. </p>

<p>Shankaracharya: I am very busy now. I have to leave now for another appoitment. If you
want to know about that, come again next time. I will answer that question then.</p>
