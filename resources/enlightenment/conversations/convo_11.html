<p>Tathagata: If I say I hope to
save your life, would you permit me to do that?</p>

<p>Samwon: Yes, I will.</p>

<p>Tathagata: The way that saves you exists in yourself. First of all, I have
something that I should identify.</p>

<p>Samwon: What is that?</p>

<p>Tathagata: Could you travel around with me?</p>

<p>Samwon: I will retire from all my official positions in 
two years. From
that time on, I would like to travel with you and see what you do.</p>
