<p>Tathagatha: I am very glad to
meet you today. May I ask you something?</p>

<p>Seongbon:
Sure.</p>

<p>Tathagatha:
Then, can you tell me what you are teaching to people around you.</p>

<p>Seongbon:
I teach on the Scripture, commandments and meditation in Buddhism.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Are the contents of
the Scripture what Buddha tried to teach, or what religions invented?</p>

<p>Seongbon: I think they are from
Buddha.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Can you distinguish
between what someone with eyes open said and what the blind said?</p>

<p>Seongbon:
Only Buddha can do that.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Then, do you know
that it can be dangerous to yourself or other people in some aspects for you to
teach things in the Scripture?</p>

<p>Seongbon:
What do you teach?</p>

<p>Tathagatha:
I teach conscience, justice and love.</p>

<p>Seongbon:
So do I.</p>
