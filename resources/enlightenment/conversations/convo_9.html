<p>Tathagatha: What do you know about?</p>

<p>Boyd: I know nothing.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Unlike other people, you are aware of at least one thing.</p>

<p>Boyd: What is the one thing?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: You said that you didn’t know anything, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Boyd: I have lived through the period when autocracy was replaced by
communism and then by capitalism. My expectation about the world has always diverged from the reality. When I
expected that result would be like this it turned out another way, and vice
versa.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: It is because your
sight has not been opened to things of the world yet. Will it be O.K. if I ask
a question of you about this matter?</p>

<p>Boyd: Yes, it will.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Love is one of the words people can hear most. I wonder how
you teach love to people. Can you tell me the definition of love?</p>

<p>Boyd: Love is the thing that we
cannot say.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: If that is your answer, it means that you don’t know love yet.
I am always teaching this love to people and I begin with teaching conscience
and justice. Conscience is the way to brighten mind and justice is the way to
brighten the world. If people with bright mind can live in the bright world, it
would be the best blessing.</p>

<p>Boyd: If I find anything I will
not understand, may I ask you them?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Yes, you may.</p>

<p>Boyd: Please let me have your address.</p>
