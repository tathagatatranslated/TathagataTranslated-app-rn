<p>Tathagatha: In Christianity, what do they teach?</p>

<p>Wanzala: They teach the words of God.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What do you mean by the words of God?</p>

<p>Wanzala: The words of God are in the Bible.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: If you are a Christian you must have read all the contents of
the Bible, mustn’t you? What is the main content in the Bible?</p>

<p>Wanzala: It is love.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What do you mean by love?</p>

<p>Wanzala: Love cannot be explained.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Why?</p>

<p>Wanzala: It is because only God is aware of love.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: If so, hasn’t God ever taught the very love to you yet?</p>
