<p>Professor: All these gentlemen here are those who examine doctorates in
this university.</p>

<p>Tathagata: What is their
academic specialty?</p>

<p>Professor: It is philosophy.</p>

<p>Tathagata: If so, may I check one thing?</p>

<p>Professor: Yes, you may ask whatever you want.</p>

<p>Tathagata: People are saying the word, philosophy, easily. If you try to
express philosophy with one sentence, please answer where we should put the
definition on. (What is the definition of philosophy?)</p>

<p>Professor: All of us here have
been making efforts to find the answer day and night.</p>

<p>Tathagata: Did you mean you do
not know exactly about the term, philosophy, yet?</p>

<p>Professor: â€¦</p>

<p>Tathagata: If I were you, I would ask about what I have tried to know.</p>
