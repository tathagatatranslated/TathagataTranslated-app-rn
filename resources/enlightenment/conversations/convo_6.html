<p>Gupte: Can you tell where my soul is?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: I would like to
identify your sight – in what way you see things – first before I answer your
question. Where does the bean come from?</p>

<p>Gupte: The bean comes from the bean itself, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Yes, it does. Your
soul lies in the deep inside of your heart and it exists through what happened
in your life. If the present activities of you life stop you will revive
through the soul.</p>

<p>Gupte: Although a great number
of people have made efforts to understand the fact nobody could explained about
it easily.</p>
