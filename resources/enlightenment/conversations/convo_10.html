<p>Giryeo: Do you believe in God?</p>

<p>Tathagata: I do not have any religion.</p>

<p>Giryeo: Then, what do you believe?</p>

<p>Tathagata: I only believe the things in the truth.</p>

<p>Giryeo: What do you do?</p>

<p>Tathagata: I am the president of Society of Natural Science.</p>

<p>Giryeo: Now, how many members are there in the society?</p>

<p>Tathagata: At the moment, I am the only member but there will come more from now on.</p>

<p>Giryeo: Hahaha â€¦ See? Only you believe in what you believe in but a great
number of people believe in God. Which side do you think is correct?</p>

<p>Tathagata: The number does not
say something is correct or wrong. What exists in themselves makes good or bad
things come into being.</p>
