<p>Tenshav: People from Tibet say that Dalai Lama is an enlightened being.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: What are the evidences that he is enlightened?</p>

<p>Tenshav: Do you know the evidences?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Tenshav: what are they, then?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: In my case, I can show you four kinds of them. The first one
is the symbol on my forehead called the third eye. The second one is ‘Ui-Tong*’
in my consciousness. The third one exists in my behavior, which means the
enlightened being does not crave the five desires. The last one exists in my
words, which says falsehood doesn’t exist in the words of the enlightened
being.</p>

<p>Tenshav: I have never seen such
evidences from Dalai Lama.</p>
