<p>Agwani: Please tell me about the future of Indian people.</p>

<p >Tathagatha: Things in the future
come into being through what exists in reality. As long as consciousness isn’t
changed, things in reality can never change. In order for Indian society to be
changed, things in the consciousness of Indian people should be first changed.</p>

<p >Agwani: Why is Korea where someone like you live so noisy everyday?</p>

<p >Tathagatha: Ignorant people are
subject to live anywhere in the world. In Korea, lots of ignorant people live. So there are so many noisy things, too.</p>

<p>Agwani: Then, what kind of hospitality do you receive in your own country?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: I am not the one who doesn’t receive any hospitality from even
my wife at home.</p>

<p>Agwani: I believe you. You are a true man.</p>
