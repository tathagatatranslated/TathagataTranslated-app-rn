<p>Vaswani: There are lots of people in the world who insist that they are
enlightened.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Then, have you ever met anyone that says they are enlightened?</p>

<p>Vaswani: No, I have not.</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Even though you haven’t met directly anyone that they say so
how can you say so?</p>

<p>Vaswani: Have you ever met an enlightened being?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: No, I have not.</p>

<p>Vaswani: If you meet the enlightened being how can you recognize whether
he is enlightened or not?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: Firstly I ask some questions and through the answers I can
notice if he is enlightened.</p>

<p>Vaswani: Then, could you ask me the questions you have asked people?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: I have been waiting for you saying so. By the way, I’m wondering one thing before I ask you
questions?</p>

<p>Vaswani: What are you wondering?</p>

<p>Tathagatha: At this moment, I wonder what questions can be answered by you
when I ask them. So, if you know anything, tell me just one thing among them.
Then I will ask about it.</p>

<p>Vaswani: I don’t know anything. You are the true enlightened being.</p>
