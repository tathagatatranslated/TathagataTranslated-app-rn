<h3 align="center">PERSON MET IN PUNA<br/>by ven.soyoun</h3>
<p>I was travelling South East Asia in 1990.<br />When I arrived at a city in the south of India, called Puna, teacher who I follow said to me.<br />&ldquo;Let intellectuals in this place know that I come to this place.&rdquo;<br />I was busy wandering about here and there to inform of Teacher&rsquo;s message in a city of a country that I didn&rsquo;t know well.<br />As Puna is a city of education in India, many people who have high reputation lived there. What I found out was that Puna University was famous in philosophy.<br />I visited Puna University and knocked on the door of the vice chancellor&rsquo;s.<br />I found out later that the person, who I saw when the door was open, was the vice chancellor. But I didn&rsquo;t know him at that time so I asked him,<br />&ldquo;Could you tell me where the chancellor is?&rdquo;<br />The person in front of me said, &ldquo;What is the reason that you are looking for him?&rdquo;<br />I said to him showing Teacher&rsquo;s message,<br />&ldquo;This person came to Puna from Korea and he&rsquo;d like to meet intellectuals of India.&rdquo;<br />The person read the teacher&rsquo;s message and without hesitation he fixed a time and said he would meet Teacher.<br />I went to Puna University with Teacher the day of the appointment.<br />When teacher and I arrived at the office of the vice chancellor, two people welcomed us. One was the person who I&rsquo;d met the last time, the other was I had not seen before.<br />I asked the person I met last time, indicating the new person,<br />&ldquo;Is he the chancellor?&rdquo;<br />The person who I met last time said he wasn&rsquo;t.<br />I only then knew the person who I met the last time was the vice chancellor, Doctor Gupta. The other person was a widely known professor in psychology.<br />I, first, introduced to both people the teacher who came from Korea, and later introduced both people to Teacher, but the teacher introduced himself to them.<br />&ldquo;I am the person who is the most truthful man in the world.&rdquo;<br />I was worried if they were confused about the teacher&rsquo;s words. So I made an additional remark in a hurry.<br />&ldquo;He is saying about the visual angle that he has.&rdquo;<br />It seemed that they were accepting teacher&rsquo;s words without rejection. Teacher asked a few questions to the chancellor and the professor. And the teacher said that if there were things they wanted to know, to ask him.<br />At that time, Doctor Gupta, the chancellor of Puna University, said.<br />&ldquo;Could you tell me where my soul exists?&rdquo;<br />Teacher answered like this.<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But before I tell it, I&rsquo;ll give you a question first. After listening to your answer, I&rsquo;ll tell you to understand easily about it.&rdquo;<br />The chancellor asked again.<br />&ldquo;What are you going to question?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Where are beans from?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a bean come from a bean?&rdquo;<br />Teacher said with a delighted smile.<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. A bean comes from a bean. However, from a bean&rsquo;s point of view, because it is rooted to the ground it could see differently. As a bean comes from a bean, so your soul is in you. Your soul is made through your activity. And you will be born again due to things that were in your soul.&rdquo;<br />Doctor Gupta was very sufficient and said,<br />&ldquo;Many people around us tried to know about such a thing but were not able to know.&rdquo;<br />Doctor Gupta and the professor had many conversations with Teacher since then. When the appointment time was over, it was time to separate. Doctor Gupta said to Teacher,<br />&ldquo;The words that you told us today were very beneficial. When you come to Puna next time, could you visit us without fail, please.&rdquo;<br />Teacher delightedly consented and the chancellor and the professor respectfully sent off us.</p>
