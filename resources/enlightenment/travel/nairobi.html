<h3 align="center">PEOPLE MET IN NAIROBI<br/>by ven.soyoun</h3>
<p>Our Party went to Nairobi, capital of Kenya in Africa in September 1990. There was a large scale Muslim mosque. Master Tathagata doesn&rsquo;t speak English but he returned with an appointment with the people there.<br />We arrived in the Muslim mosque 15 minutes earlier than the appointment. Several tens of Muslims were gathered and a Muslim professor was giving a speech.<br />After the meeting the Muslim professor came to us. More than 20 Muslims followed him. He came closer to Master Tathagata and asked.<br />&ldquo;What is your religion?&rdquo;<br />Master Tathagata answered.<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a specific religion. I am the teacher who sees things that exist in the world and teach the things that exist.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;<br />He indicated me.<br />I said to him. &ldquo;I am a Buddhist nun.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I heard that you make statue with tree, and you bow to it and consecrate money.&rdquo;<br />He spoke as if he were ridiculing us, and other Muslims around him were looking at us and sneering.<br />I drastically interrupted him.<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do such things. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t let other people do such things.&rdquo;<br />Master Tathagata said to them.<br />&ldquo;Since I came to thins place I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone who tries to bless their own future. What do you do for your future?&rdquo;<br />The Muslim professor replied.<br />&ldquo;I worship the God and live in faith. We are following the path of prophecy.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The people of Israel worshiped the God. But they killed an upright person, and in the end they destroyed their own. What is the difference between you and them?&rdquo;<br />He and the other Muslims, who listened to those words, were angry and their voices got louder.<br />&ldquo;You said you can see all things of the world. Then how many rivers are in the sky?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many rivers are in my country much less the number of rivers in the sky.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;There is a record of such things as well in the Koran.&rdquo;<br />Master Tathagata said impatiently.<br />&ldquo;Do you believe things that exist or not exist? If there is one who teaches you the world will you follow and learn from him?&rdquo;<br />The Muslim professor replied with a high voice.<br />&ldquo;I only follow the Koran. It is revelation of the God. If you came from the sky, What is the evidence? Give evidence!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The evidences are in my body, mind, and wisdom, that know things of the world.&rdquo;<br />I have the eye of wisdom, my mind can beat all the devils and vanish human being&rsquo;s sins.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want such evidence and we cannot recommend it either. Die in this place and restore again to life. Then we will believe your words.&rdquo;<br />They sneered at us tittering. They shouted at us, &ldquo;Quickly go back to Korea!&rdquo;<br />When they turned rough, Master Tathagata gathered two hands and saying &ldquo;Thank you, thank you&rdquo; with a smile, came our of the place.<br />I couldn&rsquo;t understand his behaviour so I asked.<br />&ldquo;What was thankful so that did you say &lsquo;thank you, thank you&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it thankful letting go without doing a useless thing for long. But I won&rsquo;t come to Africa by myself again. These people have caused their own unhappiness. The place where ignorance and badness coexist is a very fearful place.&rdquo;</p>
