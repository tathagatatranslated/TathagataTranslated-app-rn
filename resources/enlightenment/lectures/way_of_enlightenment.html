<p>Anyone can save themselves through Enlightenment. However, enlightenment is little known amongst people. Furthermore, there are none who have sufficient understanding of, and know the correct teaching about enlightenment. Therefore, enlightenment itself cannot be an important goal of life.</p>
<p>If life itself is not precious to us, we could say we don&rsquo;t have any reason to live. There are many people who have wasted much time for enlightenment from ancient times. However, only one person was recorded to have completed enlightenment thousands of years ago. Such a thing is caused from the fact that the way to enlightenment has not been transmitted correctly in the human world.</p>
<p>Then, why was it that such a good teaching was unable to be transmitted through people to the world?</p>
<p>People are moved by consciousness and are active by consciousness. Therefore, people don&rsquo;t accept that which doesn&rsquo;t agree with their consciousness, they cannot see it properly and cannot transmit it properly. This was the point at issue that made people unable to progress to the way of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Then Why is it so difficult for human beings to bless themselves?</p>
<p>Human beings are spiritual animals because they have the ability to know, to feel, to accept and to refuse by consciousness, and because things like judging, thinking, acting and planning receive instruction from consciousness.</p>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t have good deeds in their consciousness listens to teachings about enlightenment, then those rejects it. This can be confirmed through things that have existed in the world. Such a thing can be found easily throughout the life of the 4 saints we refer to, and also, through the life of Dharma who, transmitted in Buddhism, who came to China from India. However much we say 'I want to be enlightened, I want to be enlightened', Enlightenment cannot be accomplished in the situation of not accepting Truth and not understanding Truth.</p>
<p>In order to achieve enlightenment it should be started by understanding things in Truth, and accepting Truth. This is difficult depending on people. Because things that happened in the past in oneself refuse such a thing.</p>
<p>Shakyamuni left words that even Buddha could not save mankind if there was no 'cause and occasion'. So however much it is a good teaching, one without 'cause and occasion' cannot accept it. It means that good 'cause and occasion' hasn&rsquo;t been done in oneself, one doesn't have connection to good 'cause and occasion'.</p>
<p>An enlightened being appeared in the past world, but people didn't come near to the enlightened being. This was because people were not able to recognise him. Therefore, the enlightened being tried to awaken people travelling on foot until he died at age 82 on the road. In those days, when people travelled on foot due to no benefit of civilisation, Buddha wouldn&rsquo;t had been treated well teaching people travelling on a palanquin. He travelled endlessly because there weren't people near to him all the time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most people who have tried to awaken others except Buddha, were killed by human beings. Socrates and Jesus Christ were condemned to capital punishment to die through the bestowal of poison or crucified on the cross. And Lao-tsu wandered about all his life long and died.</p>
<p>And yet, why did the people of posterity said they are saints? It was because they didn&rsquo;t compromise with injustice and there was Truth in their teaching, the people of posterity were evaluated them as saints. However, it was many years after they died when they were treated as saints. They were people who lived not as a saints, but the most lonely life when they were alive.</p>
<p>The reason that we made people who gave enlightenment to the human world feel loneliness and pain is that Truth wasn&rsquo;t transmitted properly, and was a phenomenon that occurred among the people who had a lack of understanding of Truth. We should be more concerned with such facts.</p>
<p>Then let us find out how we can solve this problem so that we can live life with the aim of enlightenment, or save oneself through enlightenment.</p>
<p>The reason that we want enlightenment, and we want to be near to the teaching of enlightenment is to open our eyes to the truth. Thus only the person who tries to know the truth can approach enlightenment.</p>
<p>One common fact when enlightened beings appeared was that they saw the world of origin. No one can go into the world of origin with Karma. One comes to reach to the world of origin when Karma has all died out. The world of origin is the place where everything dies and is reborn. The people who saw the world of origin were only two among people who came to the world.</p>
<p>One was Shakyamuni. Thus, the world that enlightened beings commonly come to see is the world of origin and the world of Salvation. As only the person who attains Salvation can come into the world of origin, the world of Salvation is the same as the world of origin.</p>
<p>In plain language, becoming to gain complete truth is escaping from all things infected with falsehood. Otherwise, people with Karma never can attain 'Salvation'.</p>
<p>Person who don't attain 'Salvation' are never able to be enlightened. Namely, the person can not achieve the last enlightenment; It is difficult to open eyes to the perfect truth.</p>
<p>Enlightenment isn't a thing that you can get abandoning family and undertaking mountaineering asceticism. Enlightenment can be attained having family, and is a thing that cannot be attained through mountaineering asceticism. Enlightenment starts from accepting Truth and process of understanding Truth.</p>
<p>Those people who tried hard for a long time, leaving their family in order to undergo mountaineering asceticism in places like the Himalayas, didn't attain enlightenment, but they performed an action that was effectively abandoning themselves. If someone wanted to be enlightened whilst having Karma inside oneself, without abandoning the Karma, one did things that instead killed oneself.</p>
<p>How could one be enlightened with Karma! All that make our thought exist occur from things that happened in ourselves in the past. How could they be enlightened! It is impossible an enlightened being appears in the situation of not removing Karma that has been built in oneself in the past.</p>
<p>When I saw people who say they attained enlightenment through mountaineering asceticism, or any kind of ascetic practice rather than through the way of Truth, they were engaging in behaviour that causes more Karma. They performed behaviours which deceived others and harmed others and imposed damage on others. Such things can be confirmed anywhere you go in society today.</p>
<p>Enlightenment isn't a thing that is attained by desire or hope, but through teaching. However, that teaching hasn't been transmitted clearly up to now.</p>
<p>Shakyamuni was the only person who achieved enlightenment and knew the way to make other people be enlightened. However, such Shakyamuni taught people "Look at things that are in existence! Learn things that are in existence! Know things that are in existence!" only. And when people asked about thing that is in existence, Shakyamuni explained as he saw. Things that are in existence were the way to enlighten people. That&rsquo;s why he taught about things that are in existence.</p>
<p>When the disciples asked in front of the Master's last moment of life, "If you die, from whom do we have to learn from now on?" he answered, "Learn through yourself." And also he said, "I have never taught anything of mine." This meant that he only spoke of things that are in the world, and things that exist in the world is the way to make people see enlightenment.</p>
<p>He taught that when one was wrong one naturally got retribution for the deed, and when one was right one naturally got an appropriate price. It is the Law of Cause and Effect. The cause and effect means that you get a reasonable price against your deed.</p>
<p>People are not satisfied with the results that they come to gain from what they have done. It is a trap. Those who can have satisfaction with what they have done, those are the people who are right. People lead their life with wrong thought, and so refuse something that is fair and expect something that is unfair.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is more serious nowadays. In order to go and pray in a mountain, people charter a carriage and they put a lot of money under a stone. And that, if they receive an amulet written with red colour, they put even more money. This is because they don&rsquo;t try to gain something by their effort but they hope for a miracle that occurs by a certain object. There are many people with false thought so that such a thing exists. It is inevitable falsehood exists.</p>
<p>It is impossible to reach enlightenment unless human beings abandon falsehood. It can be said that people in this age are not blessing themselves but live abandoning themselves. To speak briefly, all the saints including Gautama and Jesus, commonly said that this era is the end of the world. For that reason, people naturally do things that harm themselves.</p>
<p>Then why people do such abnormal things endlessly? It is because of ignorance. Ignorance makes oneself be deceived and make one deceive others. Ignorance is the enemy of enlightenment. These ignorant people also say to others that if they believe in them, they would be enlightened. However, far from enlightenment that way makes it difficult to preserve oneself. When a human being's consciousness is ruined, it can be reborn as an animal or plant. It can change any kind of thing. It means that consciousness itself also can be changed to other consciousness when the consciousness is ruined.</p>
<p>To attain enlightenment is, as mentioned above, acquiring truth and making truth come into being in you. It is not easy but we were able to get the answer after observing many facts. The answer is as such. When water is continuously poured into a water jar full of polluted water, the turbid water can get out of the jar due to the pressure of water pouring into jar. Accordingly, people should continuously accept teaching of existent things. It is also impossible to accept the teaching of existent thing if the truth is not awakened. Therefore, you should realize your truth. You should make your truth awaken. Good teaching makes human being realize.</p>
<p>Then, how to make human beings realise? It is possible to make them enlightened showing them what is. People in this age are ignorant so no one listens to existent thing if I try to make them realize through showing things that are.</p>
<p>There are many countries in the world, but people in Korea peninsula, among the many countries, are distinctive. What is the reality appears in the society? As everybody knows it is a gloomy reality. The result is that a lot of problems exist in the society.</p>
<p>Falsehood, deception, and things that harass others are rampant because people expect something that they didn&rsquo;t do. Accordingly, the society cannot be good. 'Cannot be good' means the same as it will not be able to be good. It means that more and more problems are created, and people get to live in the problems.</p>
<p>People who are not enlightened make themselves move by action of karma. However, an enlightened being looks at what is and lives according to what is.</p>
<p>Consequently, due to people who have big enlightenment don't move by the karma in themselves but look at what is and move fit to what is, karma cannot act in themselves.</p>
<p>All the wills in the world exist by action. Nothing appears without action. If there were no action in the world, nothing would exist and the world would exist as it were died. Because there are all sorts of action exist in the world, all things are existing.</p>
<p>Karma itself also dies if it doesn&rsquo;t act. However, when karma itself dies, it is born again. Things that had kept in oneself, among things that are born again, make them exist in oneself being active continuously. Therefore, it is impossible to expel things from oneself for good that once existed without enlightenment.</p>
<p>However, if awakening is big, Karma comes to lose work to do as people are not moved by the action of karma but look at existent thing and act to be fit to existent thing. In that manner, karma itself gets weaker and truth about existent thing grows larger.</p>
<p>If there isn't enlightenment, it makes yourself perish, and if there is enlightenment, it makes yourself gradually good. And so, when the truth grows larger and karma gets smaller, it is possible for whomever to reach Salvation through asceticism or love.</p>
<p>Depending on whether you know or don&rsquo;t know, the things of the world can be simple or complicated. In fact, things of the world are decidedly very simple. It is decided by simple meaning. However, when we don&rsquo;t know this simple thing it is very complicated to find out.</p>
<p>Nowadays human beings find out all kind of things using computers or certain new machines. However, there is a thing that even computers cannot find out. It is 'how to awaken a human being.'</p>
<p>It cannot be happen in a day that a society goes down and a lot of people have to live miserably. A thing that falls before a society falls is consciousness. If the consciousness doesn't fall a society never falls. Because the consciousness that moves us is making a world. If there exist a lot of difficulties and the difficulties make our life gloomy, it is the proof that there have existed tremendous wrong things in our society.</p>
<p>Having a poor natural environment, Japanese receive hospitality from the world but a Korean doesn&rsquo;t get as much hospitality as a Japanese. It is because of the environment that Japanese society has, a tradition that Japanese society has, and also the system that Japanese society has. The reason that a Korean doesn't get hospitality as much as a Japanese does in the world is because of the consciousness that a Korean has.</p>
<p>No matter how much force people to do a bad thing, it is difficult for people to do a bad thing after they have made themselves realise. It is because of things that are in the consciousness. However, when people are not awakened, no matter how pray people to do good things, people cannot do good things. It is also meaning that consciousness exist.</p>
<p>Without understanding about the world of consciousness, society comes to ruin the people, and the people come to ruin the society. A society's existence is based on human beings, human beings exist based on the society. A society and human being is the same relationship as head and tail of a coin.</p>
<p>Individuals exist based on society and a society exists based on the individual. Therefore, when bad people become influential in a society, that society goes to ruin, when good people become influential in a society, the society is improved. This is eternal Truth.</p>
<p>I would like to explain with what method people can get to enlightenment.</p>
<p>It is true that Gautama Buddha, who came to the world in the past, achieved perfect enlightenment. As he saw the world of origin and also attained Salvation, it is true that he achieved enlightenment. However, he didn&rsquo;t explain how people can easily reach enlightenment in the process of explaining existent thing.</p>
<p>First, "Falsehood must be extinct in order to get enlightenment." Namely, truth should appear. The meaning of "falsehood must be extinct in order to get enlightenment" is that you have to open your eyes to truth.</p>
<p>Second, "You should be able to see existent thing." Where is right or wrong? Right and wrong doesn't exist in words but come to appear through existent thing. When right result appears it is right thing and when bad result appears it is bad thing. However much you say it is good, it is difficult to produce good thing when you don't know existent thing. That's why you have to be able to see existent thing. You have to be able to know how existent thing comes to being. You have to be able to know the law of cause and effect that how existent thing can be improved or worse.</p>
<p>Third, "You must have conscience and courage." I repeatedly emphasised that there is nothing more lonely and harder than revealing existent thing to the world. Such was the life of saints in the past and so people in history who tried to teach existent thing correctly were abandoned in the world. Accordingly, even if you open your eyes to existent thing you cannot do the work when you don't have conscience and courage.</p>
<p>Fourth, "Endless love must be in oneself." When you have endless love you would try to teach others. When you have conscience and courage you would try to teach right thing to others endlessly. Without one of these it isn't possible.</p>
<p>There was endless awakening in Gautama Buddha in his previous life. So himself saw existent thing and learnt through existent thing continuously through the awakening. The endless activity made his karma very small.</p>
<p>When you do asceticism to burn a small karma, like Gautama Buddha, with eagerness to get enlightenment, for the perseverance make fire in yourself, you can vanish the karma with the fire.</p>
<p>However, such a thing is too hard, and also if such teaching goes wrong it can make one a disabled person. Gautama had accumulated good deeds throughout ages, he could remove bad karma through asceticism. But one with a big bad karma tries to be enlightened through such teaching, that one eventually becomes a disabled person by problems in itself.</p>
<p>It means to ruin organs of the body. Injecting air into a tyre, the tyre bursts when the pressure is over the limit. Also when you handle a substance when there is pressure that is more than the substance can stand, it collapse. It is clear that human body organs as well can be damaged when pressure is given continuously or unbearable pressure is received.</p>
<p>It is very hard to get enlightenment through asceticism. As everybody has returned from the world of spirits and is living in the world of life, everybody will be able to know if they confirm. No one knows how much they performed good deed or lived ignorantly in the past world. Namely, it means that no one knows things that are in themselves. Before an enlightened being attained the enlightenment, he didn&rsquo;t know he would be an enlightened being. He didn&rsquo;t know to what extent he had accumulated virtue and even what he was. Every body is the same.</p>
<p>Because Gautama attained enlightenment through asceticism, he wasn&rsquo;t able to explain enough about the way of enlightenment. He only said enlightenment could be attained through virtue but people don&rsquo;t understand the virtue itself correctly.</p>
<p>For example, even if people directly give money to a swindler and be deceived, if the swindler says &ldquo;you did an act of charity.&rdquo; Ignorant people, who are like blind, think they did so just from listening to the words.</p>
<p>However, the result is different. These ignorant people even don&rsquo;t know such thing will bring what kind of result. Therefore, people shouldn&rsquo;t judge only from listening to words.</p>
<p>Why is enlightenment so important? Does someone serve you a meal if you are enlightened? Does someone give you money? Is it possible to be successful in life?</p>
<p>There are many people who doubt these points. However, the reality is beyond those people&rsquo;s thought. The only thing is that others don't bring all those things for you but acquire for yourself. When you need money, you make money through work. It is not making money robbing other&rsquo;s safe but make money through work. In such a way it is possible to be either a president or a king.</p>
<p>Goutama said "those who has origin to get enlightenment can be either king or good and wise king, or a great leader when the person is born." It means that the person is born with the way to be greatly successful and to have great wealth and fame already. Therefore, people come to obtain their lacking through enlightenment.</p>
<p>No matter how much you know, you cannot save yourself without practice. You have to burn yourself away searching for what is. If you know existent things your inside burns even when you work hard. Hatred doesn't occur but your inside burns. Then you will get good results through it. The result is the same when you burn your inside for your children. The result is the same when you burn your inside for others. The result is the same when you burn your inside for your husband.</p>
<p>It is similar between burning your inside and boiling your inside. When you boil your inside, your inside is painful. Hatred and hateful occurs and inside of you boils. But people don't know whether it is burning your inside or boiling your inside.</p>
<p>However, when you truly understand existent thing of the world and feel anxious about either what your husband does, or what your children do, or what people in the world do, your chest burns.</p>
<p>It only burns your mind but hatred doesn't occur. Fire breaks out vigorously within you and getting hot without the occurrence of hatred is burning. It is boiling when inside of you is painful occurring hatred.</p>
<p>Occurring hatred is accumulating karma, and burning inside of you without occurring hatred is burning your karma. When you love either your children or anything, things that come to light from the person you love make you feel anxious. You are able to burn yourself with the feeling of frustration. It is important to know this.</p>
<p>It is not performing an action of virtue going to church, temple or following people in society. The Important thing is that how much you have enlightenment in yourself, and tried to perform love having many objects that you love through enlightenment. At this time, just the actions appear.</p>
<p>Fire can begin from the action and that fire makes the karma burn. We need teachings that exist in Truth in order to eventually get to perfect enlightenment by burning ourselves out.</p>
<p>People who don't know Truth say as if it is a great thing. But people who know Truth don&rsquo;t say it is a great thing. Truth is what is itself and everything that you see when you only open your eyes.</p>
<p>Your highest aim is how you can get enlightenment and how you bless your life. Blessing self through enlightenment isn&rsquo;t far away but just in yourself. It should occur in yourself.</p>
<p>It would be a desire of people sending their children to a university. But it is not a great thing to send their children to a university. It is because education in Korea is not creative but memorising. Education in Korea is different from the education in other countries. Education in Korea comes from intensive memory. The method is inputting many questions from books and accepting the questions within the head.</p>
<p>Then what happens to the person? The person receives 100 points in the exam, but if you make the person work in a factory, the person couldn&rsquo;t manage to make a product properly. It means that education ruined people&rsquo;s consciousness instead.</p>
<p>Education that doesn't enlighten is not true education. It can spoil people in certain cases. Due to the deterioration of originality, people just shuffle off a duty onto someone else without even thinking what they have to do.</p>
<p>When we know what is we can eventually say we live by our own will. Not living by the influence of the society but by the will of oneself. Then you should do things that you decided right.</p>
<p>Why has our society abandoned our will and live by other's will! As the result, there are many difficult matters which exist in our society. Because human beings are ruined, the world where human beings live comes to ruin. Nobody can deny these words.</p>
<p>However, in order for a perished man to be born as a good man again, that person has to abandon their consciousness and get a new consciousness. This is enlightenment.</p>
<p>Why enlightenment is important for us is because only enlightenment is the way to save ourselves from danger, and only enlightenment can be the blessing to guide your endless next life to bright side.</p>
<p>One who doesn't love oneself is not able to love others. Loving others has a big benefit for me as well. There is no precious thing than getting enlightenment in the world.</p>
<p>Enlightenment makes self be successful. If people are enlightened to things of the world, it is inevitable to be a man who is diligent, frugal and honest. It is a great life if you can live diligently, frugally and honestly for yourself. Such a person never can be ruined.</p>
<p>In order to not be perished, and in order to get endless oneself, there has to be some kind of enlightenment. The biggest way to get enlightenment is love. That's why love is great.</p>
<p>However, how do people, nowadays, see 'love'? They say love is expression of affection that man and woman share in a private place.</p>
<p>There exist word 'love' but true love isn't taught. What is love? It is blessing. What I have done is bless the other party, it is blessing the other party and blessing the world.</p>
