<p>Why can human beings not escape from the sphere of god, and why have gods endlessly tried to make contact with human beings?</p>
<p>The Human world still does not know about things that are in the results appeared by the action of gods. Due to this, many falsehoods existed in the human world and the damage is significant. Therefore, we would like to reveal the truth about such things.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s find out about things(matters) that exist in the world of gods and the true color of gods that try to contact human beings.</p>
<p>What object do human beings designate as god? The world where only consciousness exists after leaving the world of life is called 'The World of god', and the consciousness that exists in this world is called 'god'.</p>
<p>When we observe 'The World of god' where consciousnesses exist, we can find out there are 4 dimensions. However, it is common that gods that exist in higher dimensions do not make contact with human beings, who are in the world of life. If so, what is the true color of gods that have contacted human beings till now?</p>
<p>Human society calls the subject of god that appears in the human world with several terms. God, soul, the holy spirit, devil, ghost, etc are terms used about consciousness that is freed from life.</p>
<p>These terms all express the same subject. Occasionally, people in a certain category regard the god that they are worshipping as a special subject god. However, it is only they are insisting the same object to be different.</p>
<p>Among the consciousness that exist through the activity of life, souls that have attachment, grudge and a lot of problems in themselves stay in the human world even after they have left the world of life due to being seized with problems in themselves. And they try to contact with people.</p>
<p>Many phenomena appears to people when gods make contact with human beings. In general, people either say strange words that they usually didn&rsquo;t use, or say that human beings should worship god. And gods try to make human beings know the existence of god through many forms, such as harassing a person&rsquo;s mind, giving human body pain, and gods try to make human beings take its place to vent grudge or attachment using human body.</p>
<p>In the human world, for a human being to contact and receive god is a very misfortunate thing, and it becomes the origin to ruin one's own future.</p>
<p>Why do gods that appear in the human world try to solve things (matters) in themselves through human beings? In order to know that we should understand how the souls that make 'The World of god' exist, how they are made, and how they come to be.</p>
<p>The subject of god that appears in the human world can be examined from two different angles. Most gods are the souls that came out of the human body and a very small part of souls came out of other life form that could act for long period of time.</p>
<p>Then, why are these gods trying to make contact with human consciousness? There are many reasons that souls do not realize resurrection for a long period of time after leaving their life and try to contact to human beings remaining in the human world. In general, however, it is because these souls cannot escape from the problems in themselves.</p>
<p>Problems, that souls have, have come into existence by things that happened in their activity of life, and it is very difficult to escape from these problems because things that are existed in oneself cause endless action in self.</p>
<p>Life(Living things) leave the result, that come to be in themselves through activity, in themselves. In other words, life(living things) makes the result, that come to be by its own activity, exist in its own soul as it is. And it repeats the same action endlessly by the result. We call such thing 'karma'.</p>
<p>When a human being with much karma dies, the soul remains in the human world and trys to continue things that are inside itself through contact with human beings. This is because it is not possible for this soul to be resurrected or to move higher dimension.</p>
<p>There are four dimensions in the world of gods, and souls go to these four different dimensions individually when a human being dies. Those with little or no action of karma in oneself can go a higher dimension and those souls without a big attachment or grudge are resurrected through the cycle of reincarnation.</p>
<p>However, souls that have many things, which happened to them in the human world, in themselves owing to a big grudge and attachment remain in the human world. There are countless souls that remain in the human world after death, and some souls among these are trying to contact human beings.</p>
<p>In order to make contact with human beings, souls use a variety of methods individually. Once the soul successfully contacted with a human being, then the soul makes an attempt to control the target. The phenomenon that appears at that time is that the soul trys to inform of its existence by making the human being, who it contacted with, feel pain.</p>
<p>The majority of gods that human beings insist they have met till now are either the same as what has been explained above or relevant to similar types of souls.</p>
<p>One thing that people who live their life preciously, should think the most important, is to understand the effect on self due to soul of gods.</p>
<p>In fact, many people in modern society contact with gods and are seized by them. Especially among people who are seeking religion, many of them live controlled as god&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>A truly pitiful thing is that many people carelessly speak words that aren't confirmed and act thoughtlessly, without knowing the truth of words that they are saying and their action.</p>
<p>The origin of all the phenomenon that is in the world is made by what is and what will be. In other words, things of the world exist by 'what is' in the law. However, we should pay attention that most people who contact with souls deny things in the law and in the origin of the world of phenomenon. Knowing such a thing is very important for self and the future of the world.</p>
<p>If gods, that have appeared up to now in the human world, had the ability to bless human beings, a part of the Truth of the world should have been revealed in human society already as the proof of this.</p>
<p>However, the reason that nothing has been revealed so far is that the gods that human beings contact are gods that don&rsquo;t know things of the phenomenon world or things which are in Truth. If so, the criterion to evaluate about god should be different in the human world from now on.</p>
<p>A person asked me a question.<br />"Do gods give bad influence on human life?"<br />The answer is this.<br />"A Mathematical question has the answer through formula. It isn&rsquo;t right to answer to anything in the world without seeing correctly."</p>
<p>What are things that give good influence to human beings and that give bad influence?<br />Things that exist (what is) can influence good to us and also can influence bad. The important thing for people is knowing the truth about what is.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people in society are controlled by gods and also people&rsquo;s consciousness is damaged by those who are contacting gods.</p>
<p>Shamans or diviners can see through things that were in the consciousness of a certain person using god, but they can not alter good, ill luck, fortune, and misfortune that is going to be happen to that person. On the contrary, in case a person who has not contacted a god, makes friends with a person who has a god, the possibility the person can be controlled by god is high. When people depend on god and obey god&rsquo;s will, they ignore the reality in many occasions and don&rsquo;t feel even guilty having done things that damage others.</p>
<p>If there is a person who needs god, that person should first try to inquire about why it should accept god. That person should also think about what result will its own actions bring to self when it makes contact with god and is controlled by god. This is because once people are seized by god, whoever cannot be free from control of god.</p>
<p>What is the truth of god that the human world has seen so far? The reason that it was difficult and impossible to conform about god was that the human world was lacking in understanding about the world of god.</p>
<p>If someone says he/she saw god, people must confirm what is happening to the person. And people must be on their guard against the person and god until correct judgment come to pass.</p>
<p>People who insist that they have met god in the human world force to have blind and absolute faith but doesn&rsquo;t say words of Truth about how does what is come to be.</p>
<p>If people are asked for blind and absolute faith for god by someone who is instigated by god of devil&rsquo;s soul and act as they were told, the damages by the devil will occur to the people.</p>
<p>As it was made clear already, most gods that appear in the human world were either one with weak will, one with big attachment and greed, or one with grudge that they couldn&rsquo;t solve when they lived with human body. It is the consciousness wandering about the human world after their death and these souls cannot be helpful to the human world.</p>
<p>In human history up to now, it was prevalent that human being and god come into contact in the society where big problems occur. In such society many people denied Truth and it was rampant to entrust thing of human beings to things that were in God.</p>
<p>Things of the world to be good or to be wrong isn&rsquo;t due to the influence of gods that contacted with human being but the results can be different according to how much human consciousness can understand things of the world and act correctly.</p>
<p>If there is religious teaching that can bless human beings in nowadays religions or in gods, then the teaching should be revealed in the human society even now. And people, who are in contact with god and put god forward, have to show the definite proof that god&rsquo;s words are the same as things of reality and they have to say the teaching that is necessary for human life or necessary information for human society.</p>
<p>Words that are plausible, stories that didn&rsquo;t happened and stories that cannot be confirmed cannot be helpful to the way of truthful life that people who try to achieve the hope in the human world pursue.</p>
<p>Good teaching is to make understood the process that makes good and bad results happen, revealing the truth of what is. However, human society doesn&rsquo;t have good teachings and it is a matter of concern for human life.</p>
<p>The reason that holy men appeared in human history and tried to awaken human beings is because human beings couldn&rsquo;t recognize about what is correctly in many cases. In order for human being to understand what is correctly, they, first, must confirm any kind of thing. All the things in the world have answer through the principle and this answer appears through the problem that what is has and the problem which is connected with it. And when you confirm any kind of problems with the principle, you can recognize the answer easily.</p>
<p>Gods make problems to human beings rather than being beneficial. Then why has human society worshipped god and thinks god is helpful for human beings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that all the gods cause damage to human beings. However, gods that remain in the human world appear in the human world because they couldn&rsquo;t abandon things that happened in themselves due to not awakening ignorance in their life. That&rsquo;s why such gods cannot be helpful at all for human world.</p>
<p>There is, in religion, a few people who claim that they can cure other&rsquo;s diseases but we should examine the truth of such claim. If they show a miracle it must be clearly explained what the cause was and how such a thing come to happen.</p>
<p>However, when we closely observe those who perform miracles gathering many people in religion, we can confirm strange things.</p>
<p>The body of human being makes oneself exist by organs that compose the body and action of organs. However, if god could change whatever human beings want, then, why does human society need hospital and why does it have to happen that human beings lose their life due to things that they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>If there was an actual case that a miracle happened to a person, the possibility is high that it happened by god&rsquo;s deliberate play.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a car to run when a person, who can control a car as it wants because knowing a certain level about the engine of a car and the principle, puts an obstacle deliberately in a certain part of a car. But if the person get rid of the obstacle and return it to primarily state, then the car can run normally.</p>
<p>The same as this, if a god come into contact with a certain person and caused abnormal symptoms making an obstacle deliberately in an organ of the body and if the god put the organ primary state, the abnormal symptom comes to disappear. In that case, people say that miracle occurs.</p>
<p>Religions in human society make human being closer to god and to be further from things that are in the reality by putting God forward.</p>
<p>If religion that put Jesus forward try to give blessing to human beings, it must tell his teaching. But the religion introduces ability of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; and says just believing in Jesus you can be saved and also obtain eternal life.</p>
<p>There is not case at all that &lsquo;The God&rsquo; itself influenced in any kind of matter of the world, when we confirm through things that were in the world. Religion says Jesus came to the world borrowing a human body as a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo;, but there up to now is nothing that is revealed as a proof that Jesus was a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo;. It is a common sense that in a trial something without proof does not influence Judgment.</p>
<p>However, the religion states record as the evidence that Jesus was a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; and it is because he was born from the body of a virgin.</p>
<p>Then, we can confirm the fact through record. According to record, there was a woman in childbirth and a man in the place where baby Jesus was born. The relationship between the woman in childbirth and the man was that they were engaged to be married. The reason that the woman in childbirth happened to give birth as a virgin is because she hadn&rsquo;t been legally married with the man. She was a virgin as a social standing.</p>
<p>If it insists that the baby is a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; because a woman became a woman in childbirth as a social standing of virgin which is not married yet, then countless of The God&rsquo;s children are being pregnant at this moment in this country. And if there wasn&rsquo;t medical technology of obsterics and gynecology, the countless of The God&rsquo;s children would be born.</p>
<p>To distinguish whether it is true or not about all the matters of the world, it is the most correct to confirm through what is.</p>
<p>According to record, Jesus never said, even once, that he was a son of The God while he was active in the world. Jesus had a father and a mother and he said that he was a son of human being.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a thing that human beings must know is that it has nothing to do with them whether Jesus was a son of The God or not.</p>
<p>What is the use of things that are not relevant to matters(things) of one's ownself and what value does something have when it is not helpful to oneself?</p>
<p>The reason that the human world needs Jesus is that he was a very eminent man, he was a man with a big conscience, and he stepped forward in front of human beings running the risk of being in danger and difficulties in order to awaken human being&rsquo;s foolishness.</p>
<p>Religion says that Jesus said, "No one can be saved without going through self." So it insists to receive Jesus and to be saved.</p>
<p>Jesus knew a little the principle of the world. He explained that all the things that happen to people&rsquo;s life are the results that come into appear due to things that happened in themselves.</p>
<p>"No one can save self without going through I."</p>
<p>Are the object of 'I' and the object 'self' the same or different?</p>
<p>They are words that indicate the same object.</p>
<p>It is the principle in the world that nobody can save oneself without going through oneself. All the things in the world do not exist by will of 'The God'.</p>
<p>One's own life is influenced the most by one&rsquo;s own will.</p>
<p>If I go to a construction site and work for a day, I could earn one hundred thousand won(Korean currency, about 80USD) but if I don&rsquo;t do because I am reluctant to work, then I couldn&rsquo;t earn one hundred thousand won. It is by my own will.</p>
<p>Whether I go to work or not and make myself starve or have a full stomach, it is not the will of God but it is entirely my own will.</p>
<p>If I work hard, and buy enough food and eat, my stomach would be full. If I don&rsquo;t work and couldn&rsquo;t buy enough food owing to shortage of money, my stomach would feel hungry. Such things are not the will of god. It is all caused by my will.</p>
<p>Therefore, the words &ldquo;No one can save self without going through I&rdquo; means that oneself must save oneself for oneself.</p>
<p>As it was explained above, the human world didn&rsquo;t teach properly things that are important to human beings&rsquo; life.</p>
<p>People are not able to distinguish between what is good teaching and what is bad teaching. Furthermore, because people are not able to see what is properly they always understand with their thought and decide.</p>
<p>The world exists in the law. The world of the law refers to create a phenomenon when what is meets what is, and there exist things that make all sort of phenomenon in the world.</p>
<p>Whoever comes to understand about such things, they can make good life depending on themselves not depending on others.</p>
<p>People try to depend their matter on religion, but if they go to religious places they will be deceived twice. I am not saying that churches or temples are to deceive people. However, if people visit such place frequently and try to depend on others, they, first of all, will be deceived by people, and next they will be deceived by god.</p>
<p>It would be fair and important that we always confirm the truth about the assertion that religion of today puts forward. If people follow exactly religious teaching which explains the path to reach salvation through 8 right path, they will lose oneself. To loss self means to kill oneself.</p>
<p>When oneself is lost thought doesn&rsquo;t occur. Then the person either turned to an idiot or become further blind, who cannot see what is even if it sees. Otherwise, if one became either to see another place other than when they are sitting or see through others mind, it is that the one obtained a god that wandering around in the air and come to say words that the one doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>'Believe in Jesus!' Then does Jesus settle everything for you? It is not true. We have to learn The Truth that made exist what is in the world. The proof of The Truth should be confirmed everywhere in the world. It is because what is is the Truth.</p>
<p>Religion always speaks of others. It doesn&rsquo;t teach people to depend on themselves by awakening themselves, but teaches people to depend on Buddha, Jesus or God.</p>
<p>However, the world doesn&rsquo;t make all the thing exist by will of Buddha or Jesus. The world makes itself exist rising wills that all the things in the world have.</p>
<p>However much you pray, you cannot obtain what you want through pray. God might show you magic due to you pray with your utmost sincerity. However, because god cause to happen a strange phenomenon, it isn&rsquo;t truly helpful to life of human being.</p>
<p>The most important thing for human being while they live is to take precaution against god. However, human society doesn&rsquo;t know properly the importance of such thing.</p>
<p>If one lent its body to god as religion taught to depend on dead person, if god lead the body, it is the same that the person didn&rsquo;t do anything for itself while living. It is that he/she lived god's life after all, it is resulted the person, who lived others life, abandoned its future. Abandoning oneself, it isn&rsquo;t right thing.</p>
<p>The fact that a man was born in human world through life activity is glorious because it is chance to bless oneself.</p>
<p>However, todays human world is heaven for Ghost. It is because history is not continued by human being in the human world but many things happen by control of god.</p>
<p>If we see Chinese book called Confucianism, thoroughly right words are written.<br />'The three basic principles in human relations and the five moral rules in human relations'</p>
<p>It is very good teaching, if someone who don&rsquo;t know see. But it is very dangerous teaching, if someone who knows see.</p>
<p>'Serve King, Be dutiful to one's parents, Be brotherliness with brothers.'<br />However, the most important thing is missing there. Good words are arranged in there and it request good results but there is not teaching that will produce good result.</p>
<p>If human being has the human being character, one would serve well the king and there would be brotherliness between brothers. However, without teaching for perfection of human being how it is possible to make human being to recognize things of the world. And if human being cannot recognize what is, even if you open your eyes you are the same as blind. Buddha expressed it ordinary people were blind with open eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, good teaching like 'the three fundamental principles and the five moral disciplines in human relations' made people further blind with open eyes.</p>
<p>Because all the religions nowadays are the same as that, the teaching of religion causes people to lose oneself. And because religions do not reveal what is, people are becoming more and more ignorant and foolish.</p>
<p>The best message that we have to bear in mind in this age is to take precaution against falsehood. If people come to recognize what is, people turn to someone who has good sense and with firm character. The world where such people live a lot is bright and affluent. The fact that we couldn't make such a history is the proof that there wasn't right teaching.</p>
<p>Energy of consciousness exist in the middle of heart of human being and this energy makes its consciousness(soul) through activity of consciousness.</p>
<p>Soul inputs and maintains things that happened to itself in itself. Therefore, acting billions of matters inside the soul moves human being. These are again input in the soul. People could reach Nirvana, eternal life or hell by the soul that was made through out its life.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not that people can obtain an eternal life or be saved doing a lot of heartly pray, or it is not that people can go to paradise doing a lot of donation to a temple and praying sincerely. Whoever recognizes what is and make an effort, can enter into Nirvana, live eternally and can live happy and peaceful life.</p>
<p>The destiny of human being is made by things that were in oneself, and by things that are connected with oneself. It is necessary to human beings enlightenment in order to solve problems that oneself has. If one is enlightened about a certain thing, the one can do it without going wrong. That&rsquo;s why enlightenment is important.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the self that you want, you first should escape from the destiny that you yourself made. It is impossible to turn yourself to good destiny without abandoning your own wrong destiny. When action doesn&rsquo;t change, the consciousness doesn&rsquo;t change as well. When consciousness doesn&rsquo;t change, action doesn&rsquo;t change as well. This is the law and thing that whoever can see.</p>
<p>If human beings come to recognize such things correctly, their life will do very important thing for itself. However, if human beings deny such thing or cannot open their eyes to what is, it is unfortunate thing like abandoning its life by itself.</p>
