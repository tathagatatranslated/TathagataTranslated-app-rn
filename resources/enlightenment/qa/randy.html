<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Randy</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata.</p>
<p>All I've ever thought about is why we're here. They tried to raise me a christian but apparently I had too many questions they just dont have answers to. Seems like blind faith lacks the truth you speak of. I need to know what I can do to be enlightened. I came across your page when I googled &quot;find enlightenment&quot; and you had an e-mail adress to send questions to. Is this actually the enlightened one's e-mail ? Please write back.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Randy,</p>
<p>I read your mail. It's not my personal e-mail but the e-mail is owned by people who is helping my work. For a moment, whenever you send it to the address, I can receive your mail. If you ask about Christianity, any Christian can not explain about that. At the beginning, they didn't create the religion for informing what is but for informing a myth which they created. Because of that, in their teaching, there is no problem and no answer. Therefore, they tell you any answers are God's will and if some problem appears, they just say it's God's will. However, whenever they have a fault, they support God. So, without God, they can not answer anything. That is their position. If you are lucky enough to be free from a temptation of Christianity, it's a big blessing for yourself but I don't know until when you can protect yourself from a temptation of the world without the Enlightenment. But, to research the matter and to look out will be the most important thing for you. First of all, you need to check what is good or bad thing, and then you can accept it. I'd like to say you are not damaged absolutely by the checking.</p>
