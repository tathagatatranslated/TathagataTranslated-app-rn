<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Nexarius,</p>
<p>If you have another chance to send me your question,try to make it easier,please.</p>
<p>There are evil and good in the world because there are ignorance and enlightenment in the world. When you know a thing it is easy for you to do good voluntarily . When you don't know a thing it is difficult for you to do good. That's why you put yourself into evil simply. I hope that you will be able to understand that ignorance is the cause of evil while enlightenment is the cause of good. </p>
