<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Cri</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>I have been working hard to achieve concrete results in my life, but despite all my efforts it seems everything goes wrong. I think to be a good person, I do not look for extraordinary things but I am starting to be so tired because I fight without success. It could be my karma but I do not know how to change it. I lost my way and everything looks me impossible. I would like to thank you for what I read and for your anwer. </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Cri,</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for you to see the world with the closed eyes. But when you open your eyes you become to realise what is in front of you.You do not have good enough understanding and realization about the world. That's why all of the consequences that you see is no more than exposure of your problems. If you try to learn what is in the reality, eventually you will be able to change your destiny and will succeed in whatever you do. </p>
