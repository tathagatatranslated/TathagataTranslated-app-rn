<p>Dear Mir</p>
<p>I say I am enlightened. It means I have opened my eye to the world. If you are willing to know, I would like to tell you that everything in the world has been determined and they become to exist by the various problems in themselves. If you want to solve your wondering I would like to recommend you to learn from the basic. </p>
