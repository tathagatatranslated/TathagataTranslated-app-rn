<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Keith,</p>
<p>First, I want to know what I can help for you. Second, If I know more about who you are, I can answer you correctly about your question. As kind of people, someone can take good thing. But on the other hand, there are a lot of people who don't contact with good thing for their whole life and die. </p>
