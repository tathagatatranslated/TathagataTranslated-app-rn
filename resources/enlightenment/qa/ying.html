<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Ying</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata: </p>
<p>Should we have to do something that make us happy or do something that make others happy. When the two things have conflict, what we should do? </p>
<p>Ying</p>
<p>Reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Ying </p>
<p>In order to gain happiness you should know its condition, and the condition demands your efforts to effect itself. To make others happy, you should form the condition for it and awake them to realise where is happiness. When you find these are possible you can create happiness on your own. </p>
