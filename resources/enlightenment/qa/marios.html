<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Marios</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Firstly I believe you are wrong in a lot of key ideas, the world of truth lies only in every individuals mind, the world that revolves around us are mere illusions and lies, the way the individual perceives the world that is his truth, even though he might be living a lie. Truth are the actual thoughts a person is having during a time period. </p>
<p>Secondly perfect enlightenment will only occur when humans assume energy forms and are able to bind with the universe, there is no proof your consciousness binds with the universe apart from your word. </p>
<p>Thirdly I would like whatever proof you might be able to offer me about your enlightenment, anything.</p>
<p>Regards </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Marios,</p>
<p>I am very confused how do I understand your question. Firstly, The Truth means something that has been determined, and we name it as the Truth only on the condition of no alternation. The Truth is not made by someone but it has been determined. That's why you shouldn't deny it. In order to know if your words fit in the Truth or not you should see them on the living reality.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is very important for you to understand what enlightenment is. In a word, enlightenment means opening the eye to the things in the world and able to see 'what is'. There is no relation between the one who opened the eye and the energy of universe. The word 'universe' is used a lot by the most of the liars. When they use this term, they have to explain the standard and the background of the universe, such as what is the sphere of the universe or what happens in there. As such explanation is omitted, it is very difficult for me to mention about it. </p>
<p>Thirdly, I can show you the proof of the enlightenment immediately, but the blind cannot see the things in the world however much I indicate them. So, it is important for you to open your eye of consciouseness through enlightenment so that you could see the world. All of the proofs are in everywhere. </p>

<p>Dear friend Tathagata,</p>
<p>Firstly though I can't go into a deep explanation of the subject, I do believe my eye of consciousness is partly or maybe more, open, as I have the &quot;ability&quot; to read peoples' thoughts and project mine in their mind.</p>
<p>Secondly what is the Truth which you believe in, and that as you claim can not be altered?</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Marios</p>
<p>I could understand your circumstance after I listened to your email. I know that some people can read other's mind or thought by using the power of the other spirits when they approach to them. But at the moment you meet me you will have to rethink deeply about your ability. Because that spirit can not read what is in a higher consciousness. </p>
<p>I frequently speak this sentence to awake people-'Things in the world has been determined.' It means that everything in the phenomenal world is being created by the various problems. All the different phenomena are appeared according to the way problem A meets with problem B. Like in mathmatics the answer is determined by the problem.</p>
