<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Ingmar</h3><p>Tathagata,</p><p>Greetings to you. I find joy in us sharing space for a couple of heartbeats. I would like you to share... do you manage to express your Self without your beloved ones suffering? Do you permit Love making you suffer (like me) for their sake? And last, do you find your Realization everchanging?</p>
<p>Blessings,</p><p>Ingmar</p>
