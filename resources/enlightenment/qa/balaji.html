<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Balaji</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Can you please tell me what are my probabilities of getting enlightened in this birth, going by my spiritual progress at the current rate. can you please predict like at least will I go somewhere near enlightenment or not, so that i will complete the Journey of Self realisation by the next Birth.please tell me.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Balaji,</p>
<p>Even though many mankinds have existed in the world so far, there is not even one record that someone attained Enlightenment through a spiritual guide or spiritual contact. For that reason it's not happened even once through many those people for a long long time and it means the conclusion is no one can not come close to Enlightenment and attain the Enlightenment through the way that you're thinking. If you really want Enlightenment, first you have to understand correctly why people can not attain Enlightenment so far and the way how to attain Enlightenment, and then you should practice it and it's the only way. I hope my word will be helpful for your question.</p>

<p>Dear Balaji,</p>
<p>First of all, I need to see you and after I observe things in your Motae, I can answer you. If you show me how much knowledge you got for the Enlightenment, I can give an acurate answer. But if you don't show such things to me and you want me to answer what I didn't see, it is a really difficult matter. At the present situation, I can't answer you what will happen in your future without knowing whether you have an internal knowledge for attaining Enlightenment and know such a way or not. If you give me detailed information of yourself, I can give you an acurate answer.</p>
