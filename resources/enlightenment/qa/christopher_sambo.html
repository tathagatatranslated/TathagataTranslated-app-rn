<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Christopher Sambo</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>My name is christopher Sambo....</p>
<p>I live in the Netherlands but I grew up on an island called Curacao. </p>
<p>I am turned 24 years on the 5th of april.</p>
<p>I never liked school, I got nice grades but I never put lot of effort</p>
<p>In learning things at school becouse I felt that I can teach myself anything I wish to know at a particular time in my life. </p>
<p>and second I find school to be in benefit of the system (the system with is the structure of a community, city, island etc)</p>
<p>I also remember having many questions about certain things when I was young,.. and never was happy with the answers given to me by teachers my mother and father etc etc I know this is so because they didn't know better and the ones before them didn't know better either. </p>
<p>I came to Holland to study at a nice school but I did not complete that year and dropped out of school and lived My life unto this day.</p>
<p>I have been through a lot of situations through a lot of lessons not clear to me at the time they happened but afterwards,...after I came to understand after I came to realize that my life is a lesson for me to become a better self. </p>
<p>I always lived my life consciously...asking myself why thing happen the way they do and why things are the way they are.... since I was little.</p>
<p>But if you keep on getting the same answers everywhere,..answers that I know from inside that are not completely true, I started to put them in the back of my head. </p>
<p>until a time came when my eyes opened to certain things that I could not see before or was not aware of before and this went on like a cataclysm I wanted to find out anything I could about questions I had.</p>
<p>and today I found you..... and I would want to meet you in person and talk to you in person,... I do not want to see you for any proof </p>
<p>I do not want to see you for you to show me proof....</p>
<p>I want to come see you and I come then with an open mind</p>
<p>I want to meet you so you can teach me how to find my own proof my own answers of what is and all questions of life etc etc..... </p>
<p>I wanted to know if this would be possible...i want it to be possible becouse it is very inportant for me.</p>
<p>because if you have achieved Supreme Enlightenment you can teach people TRUE teachings .... what I have an open mind for..... my mind is open for anything and my spirit shall show me the truth of it.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>yours friendly Christopher Sambo</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Christopher Sambo,</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter. Whatever you want can be accomplished between you and me. However, even I have met a lot of people, I wasn't very helpful to them because no one is truly interested in things in themselves. If the content of your letter is true, I will find the way for you so that your every wishes could come true. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
