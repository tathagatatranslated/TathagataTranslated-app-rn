<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Dave Cote</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>Hi I would please like to meet Tathagata. Could you assist me in this? I have been searching for enlightenment, and I flip between being close to the source, then very distant...</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Love,</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Dave</p>
<p>It's easy for people to get the evil. However, in order to obtain goodness you should try very hard. As long as you want to see me I will wait you.</p>
