<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Karloze</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I have just read the home page for Tathagata.</p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to meet with him. A lot of what was written down on the page is not foreign to me at all. The life that I have lead from both is very similar to what an enlightened one would lead, and the way I live life now is a lot like what was described on your page. I have had supreme joy and confidence fill my body before, and I am on the path to achieving enlightenment, I too wish to share this knowledge with the world, and also wish to take it a step further and reach transcendence and show this world what beauty we all harbor within. Yes the life that this leads is not an easy road for sure, I have been shunned and cast away when I shared my happiness before. I wish to achieve full enlightenment, and I wish to learn from those that are on the same path as I. I hope something can be arranged, there is so much more to talk about, and even more to feel. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Karloze,</p>
<p>I welcome you anytime. I never refuse anybody who wants to visit me. My teaching is within common sense. You should remember this point. What I know is that the answers can not be made without the question. Therefore if you have something to gain you should know what problem makes it. I appreciate that you wish to be helpful to the world after having an enlightenment. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
