<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Bruce</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>I awoke in a dream and an intense white light appeared.</p>
<p>The white light is too powerful. </p>
<p>Do I become an arhant if I can merge with this light?</p>
<p>Bruce</p>
<p>Dear Bruce,</p>
<p>You said that some object is Bo-sal (arhant), but to merge with the light is not a way to be Bo-sal (arahant) who can cultivate big merit and virtue but first of all, enlightenment should be in yourself. You said that you've met the light in your dream and we should verify some things about this. Well, if you have time, come and stay beside me and verify whether you can see the light or not. Second, after getting my help, verify whether you can still see the light. If the owner of the strong light is weaker than my power, the light will not appear to you. If it will not be, I should examine it again. But I believe that this problem will solve easily. I am pleased to tell you that it is best way to change yourself by your enlightenment and your will rather than to change yourself by the will of the something outside.</p>

<p>Further response from Bruce</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>I told you I had a sharp white light appear to me. </p>
<p>You said that you could make the light stop appearing if your power is greater than the power of the light. </p>
<p>Why do you talk about stopping the light when I didn't ask about this? </p>
<p>Why do you talk about stopping the light? </p>
<p>I look forward to your answer.... </p>

<p>Further reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Bruce, </p>
<p>Someone showed the white light to you. Someone tried to show self by using light to you . You saw it through your consciousness. You have seen something that the others haven't. It means that you have one more problem than others.You should know what kind of effect you will have because of it. But there is no record that anyone took a benefit from that sort of experience. Therefore I told you something about that phenomenon to help you in case you don't have enough knowledge of it. </p>
