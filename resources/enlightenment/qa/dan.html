<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Dan</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata </p>
<p>I noticed that you travel to the United States early this year. Will you be coming back and if not. Can we come visit you in South Korea ? </p>
<p>I am interested in Spiritual Enlightenment and would like to resolve my karmic actions. What steps would be needed to do so. The truth is everywhere but to see it. How can someone that lives in falsehood be brought to the state of truth. </p>
<p>Thank you kindly </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Dan </p>
<p>Enlightenment means opening one's eye to things in the world. When you see the world you will be able to confirm that all of the effect has been determined and they are being created by the problems. In order to gain your enlightenment you should meet the enlightened master first of all. His guide and instruction will lead you to open your eye to the world. </p>
