<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Karen </p>
<p>The most important thing is that you should know how the existences came into beings</p>
<p>First of all, You should confirm the problems. In order to that you need to know the principle. In order to know the principle, I recommend you to learn it from somebody who knows, who is enlightened or a man of truth. When you become to open your eye even a little bit to this through your learning, your life will be a very smooth sailing. </p>
