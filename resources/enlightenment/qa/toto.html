<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Toto</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In your understanding is there any difference between awakened and enlightenment ? </p>
<p>Your enlightenment seems to be different from Advaita's enlightenment. </p>
<p>Can you help me to experience enlightenment ? </p>
<p>thank you very much.</p>
<p>Love, Toto Sadarudin.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Toto,</p>
<p>Awakening means wake up from a sleep, and enlightenment is to see ' what is', in other words, opening one's eye to the things in the world. There are a little difference between awakening and enlightenment, however, I 'd say that awakening oneself comes before enlightening oneself.</p>
<p>It is not always difficult to enlighten oneself. You can enlighten yourself seeing things exist in the reality. However, it seems that you are not approached yet to the problem of how you are possible to see the reality. </p>

<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind message. If there is any possibility for you or someone to help me (on how to see the reality, as you mentioned) then I will be glad to listen, please ...</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Toto</p>
<p>In order to see what is in reality you should awaken your consciousness first of all. For this you will need a good guidance. If you want to open your eye of consciousness through me you will need my guide,right? Guide means learning. </p>
