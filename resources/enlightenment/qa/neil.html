<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Neil</h3>
<p>Good day</p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could answer my question.</p>
<p>I have just read some of your website and it appears that you are talking of very similar things to Li Hong Zhi. Can I ask what you think of him and his cultivation Falun Dafa? </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Neil,</p>
<p>I have not met Li Hong zi. I have not heard of falun dafa. If his teaching is good you should find it's good result in the world. However no evidences has found. That's why there is a huge difference between his and mine. I have just come back from 5weeks trip on U.S. I have not found any enlightened being during my travelling. Moreover some people who claim that they are enlightened are possessed by the spirits of the dead. All of them works to attract living people and let those dead souls to enter the body of living people. Try to confirm what I speak and then tell me what you really want to know. </p>
