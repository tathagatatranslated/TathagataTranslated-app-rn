<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Bap</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata, </p>
<p>I have no questions or all questions in the world ! </p>
<p>I just want to know if I can be of assistance to You ? and if so: </p>
<p>Second do You allow me to &quot;tune-in&quot; to you ? </p>
<p>Sincerly yours Bap Getrouw (Jean)</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Jean,</p>
<p>It is very inconvenient that a person alive lives with the one who is dead. I can help you if you try to find yourself but I don't want to help to anybody who accepts a dead spirit and transfer it to another person. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<p>Further Response from Jean</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I partly understand what you mean. I am searching into the deepest of myself and found back the days of my </p>
<p>childhood. The days of innocence and thrust, but I was not able to find yet the Father's Will or the Will of the Supreme being. </p>
<p>And I am still looking for that. I know the percepts and I know the commandments, but I need additional strength to comply with these. </p>
<p>And it is the strength that is lacking me. So I will accept each day again to practise to have the strength and courage to continue walking.</p>
<p>Yours Jean</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Jean,</p>
<p>Enlightenment is the most indispensable condition for attaining what you want. </p>
<p>Before you recognize things in the world, you can not say anything truthful.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
