<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Eric</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>If one can open a window from one world to the next<br/>
and bring things in. What is he?</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Eric,</p>
<p>All of what we have done before death are brought to next life latently through our consciousness. But no one can transfer any materials to next life. It's impossible for anyone with any powers. I need obvious question for right answer but not a imaginary question.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
