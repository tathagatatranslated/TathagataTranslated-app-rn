<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Wadine</h3>
<p>Tathagata: </p>
<p>Because I am not a believer, yet, it is important that I ask a few questions. </p>
<p>1. Are you familiar with J. Krishnamurti ? </p>
<p>2. What is your given name ? </p>
<p>3. When I did a search for Tathagatas, there appear to be a number of Tathagatas. </p>
<p>One is a white man selling books. Do you have a book to sell ? </p>
<p>4. How does one determine which Tathagata is real ? </p>
<p>5. You said in 1984 that mankind as we know it will end. It is now 2006. Did something change ? </p>
<p>Although, I am not a believer, yet, I can relate to some things you have written. </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p>Reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Wadine,</p>
<p><U>1. Are you familiar with J. Krishnamurti ?</U></p>
<p>I haven't met him, but I've heard about him.</p>
<p><U>2. What is your given name ?</U></p>
<p>My given name is Samhan and my surname is Lee. After my enlightenment I call myself as Tathagata when I act as the guidance for humans</p>
<p><U>3. When I did a search for Tathagatas, there appear to be a number of Tathagatas.</U></p>
<p><U>One is a white man selling books. Do you have a book to sell ?</U></p>
<p>I have written a few books, however my books are not popular at all, that's why I cannot say I sell my books, because few people buy them, but you should know this, not everybody buy and read good books and people will not recognize the worth of the books until very long time passed. </p>
<p><U>4. How does one determine which Tathagata is real ?</U></p>
<p>I'm wondering who claim that they themselves are Tathagata, but I have not met anyone of them. Nobody has introduced as a Tathagata in front of me. Secondly,it is very simple to confirm the real one. You can confirm them by the things in the world. If he realises them he is Tathagata, if not, he is not. </p>
<p><U>5. You said in 1984 that mankind as we know it will end. It is now 2006. Did something change ?</U></p>
<p>There is no change. I have not confirmed the contents of the Website that you have read. Because I calculated that period by the principle and the problems in the present, you will find little mistake. The world is fixed and what is fixed has been operating. If my prediction is not correct the system of the world will face tremendous disaster. </p>
