<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Christophe</h3>
<p>Hello Tathagata,</p>
<p>I came across your website while I was actually looking for people that have lived enlightenment.</p>
<p>From what I have read until now, I have come to the right place!</p>
<p>I would love to ask you many questions but I would be more than happy if you could help me with this one.</p>
<p>Can someone that has experienced enlightenment and lost it along the way, go trough this process a second time during the same life, or is this a one time event that does not occur twice?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Christophe,</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Christophe,</p>
<p>If someone gains the enlightenment once he hardly loses it as long as he does not destroy himself. He can find it in his motae in his next life. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
