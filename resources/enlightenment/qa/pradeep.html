<p>Beloved Master, </p>
<p>I am really grateful and overwhelmed by your response. Thank you. Its been more than 10 years that I had been in this quest for enlightenment, searching in many ashrams, questioning so many so called gurus. Every time I spent a little more time with them I realized they have been repeating from the same books I have read about religion, philosophy like a bio computer. I have spent years meditating alone and with groups doing many meditation techniques, but all is failed. </p>
<p>Reading books, J.Krishnamurthy, Osho, Ramana,Zen, Tao ,Internet pages ,didn't help. </p>
<p>Conceptually I know that I am searching for that which cannot be searched. I have also heard and read that everybody's nature is enlightened only one has to discover. But all is just thoughts in the head and doesn't help. Mind keeps repeating like a parrot. I am frustrated with this bullshit. and time is passing. </p>
<p>I don't want to know ABOUT enlightenment. But I want to KNOW enlightenment. I want to know the TRUTH. </p>
<p>Something clicked inside me when I read your direct and to the point responses when I saw your website. I need a living master who can show me the Truth. Can you do that ?. I felt an urge to meet you. Are you in Pune or coming to Pune. I need to meet you ( I don't know how to frame this question ) or where can I meet you?.Where should I come to meet you </p>
<p>Please let me know. </p>
<p>Warm Regards, </p>

<p>Dear Pradeep,</p>
<p>In order to attain enlightenment you need some conditions. You should learn about things in the world to obtain them. First of all, you need to meet an enlightened teacher and learn from him about the principle and the way that the world works. After that, you should follow those conditions. The term of enlightenment means that you open your eye to the world. When you open your eye to the world it's easy for you to realise that everything in the world is operated by the Truth. </p>
<p>I usually stay in Korea, London and Malaysia. I have traveled India a lot but I don't have any plan to visit there in the near future.</p>

<p>Further response from Pradeep</p>
<p>Thanks Master, for the answer. Since you are not planning to come to India I will come to meet you for which I will have to gain on my financial aspects. </p>
<p>Till then can you say something that I can do that will prepare me for opening the eye for the world?</p>
<p>Warm Regards, </p>
<p>Pradeep</p>
<p>Dear Pradeep </p>
<p>In order to understand the world you need a basic knowledge and sense. If you have not had any chance to learn the fundamental teaching it must be difficult for me to help you understand something easily. Therefore , first of all , we need to confirm of your will if you really want to know the world or not. If you have it , let's start our basic conversation about how you will be able to recognise on your own the world you want to know . </p>
<p>Then my teachings are getting to accumulate in your consciousness and it will let your mind's eye open to see the world for yourself. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<p>Beloved Master, </p>
<p>Thanks for the response. </p>
<p>I really want to know the world. I want to KNOW the truth. </p>
<p>Are there any steps or will my knowing be gradual or all at once? </p>
<p>But what ever it is I want to know the reality. I want to realize the truth rather than just an information. </p>
<p>Please let me know how do I start. </p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Pradeep</p>
<p>Dear Pradeep </p>
<p>In order to be aware what is in the truth,first of all, you should open your eye to the things in the world. There are some steps in the process of opening your eye to the world. Many kinds of ways for enlightenment have been introduced through the books and sayings but it was not easy for people to attain enlightenment because their content didn't have enough proofs. In order to know what is in the truth you should learn the basics of how you open an eye. Secondly, you will go through some steps. At first, you should listen to the fully enlightened being about the ways. I have met lots of people on my travels. Whenever I met some people who gave me the same questions as yours I gave the same answers. The answer was that you should meet a man of truth and listen to him the world and aware yourself. Next, you should realise things in the world with your much of understanding through the first step, then you will see the phenomenon that your conscience and courage are generated. When your conscience and courage are grown enough you are able to practice love for the world for the first time. You can remove your karma by the practice love. When you finish the second step you will be able to see everything generated in the truth in the world on your own. You will see what are in the truth through your life and see exactly how the world is operated. </p>
