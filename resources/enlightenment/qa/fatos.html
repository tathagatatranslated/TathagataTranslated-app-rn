<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Fatos</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I have a question to you, you claim to have enlightenment and I believe in that sure. But can you show me the difference between the prophets that appeared on earth before and your personality and power of enlightenment.</p>
<p>For example , Jesus, Mohammed and the other prophets that did miracles and give the people of the world precious books like the Bible or the Qur'an - in which many truths about the world are stated in. Can you tell me your opinion about the prophets and books mentioned above.</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Fatos,</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Fatos, </p>
<p>I could not meet any extraordinary teachings through religion. Jesus, Mohammed and the other saints who you mentioned had their own lives but I don't know what happened in the process of their lives because I did not witness. I can tell you that I could not find that their teachings were conveyed through some books in anywhere in the world. Do you know why? The best proof should be in living reality, but we find it very hard to see their teachings in the actual.</p>
