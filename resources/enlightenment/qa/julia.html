<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Julia</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>My question is, </p>
<p>It is within our power to &quot;save&quot; ourselves, our race (as humans), our planet, our way of life. The human mind/spirit is capable of so much more than what meets the naked eye, and what the masses have been taught to believe is real. There must be a more effective way to reach the general population of the world to awaken to theses insights. I have memories of the times we are living in today, as if it has already taken place time &amp; time again. As if I have been down this road before, even as I type this message. Is there any significance to this? Will this cycle our planet has fallen into be broken, is the answer as simply and the problem itself? Why do I have memories of specific accurances that have taken place before? </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Julia,</p>
<p>The ability is not your power of memory. Those things could be reflected by an ability of a ghost (dead soul*) which came close to you. I ask you please judge by yourself how the ability gives your life any help.</p>

<p>*not part of answer but added as further meaning</p>
