<p>Reply from Tathagata,</p>
<p>Dear Ganesan,</p>
<p>I will teach anyone who wants me and I will also guide them to recognize things in the world by themselves. All of the decisions depend on yourself. If you want to learn, first of all, you need to think, and then ask me of what you should know. It will be helpful for yourself.</p>
