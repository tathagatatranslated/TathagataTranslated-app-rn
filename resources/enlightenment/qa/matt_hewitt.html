<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Matt Hewitt</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Just need to know it its true... </p>
<p>You have said yourself that if someone claims he is Enlightened or can tell me the truth, that I should try testing and confirming such claims. My mind is anxious to know whether or not you can past such a test. If you could simply tell me my favorite color and what image flooded my head as I read over your webpage, that would be sufficient proof to convince me. </p>
<p>I hope you pass this test, because I will have many questions to ask you...</p>
<p>Matt Hewitt</p>
<p>Dear Matt Hewitt,</p>
<p>I am very interested in your question. However I've never answered until I had confirmed the accuracy of questions. I will give my answer to your question about your favorite color and your image only after my confirmation through you. I've never given a wrong answer. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
