<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Shailendra</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am Shailendra, 27 years old, staying in London (basically from India).</p>
<p>I have felt a tremendous urge of seeking answers to basic existential questions.</p>
<p>I travelled a lot in my quest and sat with many guides.</p>
<p>I have been meditating for 8 years having initiated in kundalini yoga in India.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel the same restlessness same anguish. I pine to have glimpses of yogic samadhi.</p>
<p>I keep searching and trying to get hold of people who can help satiate my thirst.</p>
<p>I have come to know about you recently and am writing to you for the same reason.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to hearing from you at your early convenience.</p>
<p>Kind Regards.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Shailendra</p>
<p>If you can be enlightened and can obtain what you want for your own in reality, it would be the best. In order to get something good in the world you should try for yourself.</p>
<p>It is impossible for you to have a samadhi through meditation of kundalini yoga. </p>
<p>Somebody who has told you about that had experienced that feeling when they were possessed by dead spirits.</p>

<p>Further response from Shailendra</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata, </p>
<p>Thanks a million for your kind reply. Its a bit strange when I get to know from you that practicing kundalini yoga doesn't lead a practitioner anywhere. So, what is the way Tathagata? I have read texts after texts about kundalini yoga. Though, I haven't had any experience of samadhi myself. Tathagata, can I be helped? Can I get a direct experience from you? I am looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. </p>
<p>Kind Regards. </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Shailendra</p>
<p>One of my close acquaintances has talked to me about kundalini yoga a lot when he had met me first. But he had to give up his practice when he found that it was harmful after having terrible damage during practice of the method. It must be difficult for you to accept 100 percent of my any kinds of words as your ability is not enough to recognise the way of the world. The best way is only verification. If you show me the evidences of the benefit of kundalini yoga, like how it helped who, I will be able to teach you whether it is good or bad only after I confirm those evidences. I would like to suggest one way for you not only to solve all your doubts and questions simply but also to understand what I say. What we can do is that we visit the best yoga master in the world,then you will be able to understand my words only when you see what happens there.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
