<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From R E Greene</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>The Messiah has already come. If you were &quot;enlightened&quot; you would be <br/>
able to see him here, with us. The question though is, where is your <br/>
proof that the Messiah has not already come ? How else do you think you, <br/>
or I, or anyone, could see anything ? I know though that I am not my own <br/>
Messiah, I was incapable of saving myself.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear R.E. Greene,</p>
<p>The Messiah has a proof which can prove he or she is the Messiah. If you show me the proof clearly and the proof comes out clearly in real then I will go and meet him or her. But I've never heard and verified any information from anywhere that someone came into world as the Messiah except me. I've traveled many times for this matter and I've spent for many hours in travel.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
