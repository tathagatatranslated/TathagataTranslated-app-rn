<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Andrew B</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I am in conflict with myself.</p>
<p>Part of me is the ever present watcher, calm, understanding and wise.</p>
<p>The other part of me is the ever present pain, the suffering, the need, the ego.</p>
<p>How can I break this conflict and be my true self ?</p>
<p>I feel this true self state is near, and that I have reached a point where I need to make a transition.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>The answer of your question is simple. If yourself opens eyes to reality, all of what you've had are going to solve. However, I would like to point out that so far you don't know how to open eyes to reality and you didn't deliberate about that for a long time and your effort is not enough. First, you start to endeavor, then you ask me again, I can answer your question better than now.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
