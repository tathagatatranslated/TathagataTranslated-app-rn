<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Sean</h3>
<p>Dearest Tathagata, </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Sean. </p>
<p>There must be a reason I ran into the website and am trying to contact you now. I've never contacted a Tathagata or enlightened being that I am aware of. </p>
<p>I am lost, wondering if the use of the internet connection can tell you anything about myself from a spritual connection of some sort. Will you tell me something important? Something nobody but myself knows so I will believe and not have any doubt at all. What I should do with my life?.... or what I did in my past life? Is the hell realm my destiny ? A certain meditation practice I should specifically use? Anything will be helpful. I will be desperately waiting for a reply. I hope you can help me out. </p>
<p>It would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Warm regards, </p>
<p>Sean</p>
