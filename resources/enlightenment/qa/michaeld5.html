<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Michael</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I have browsed through your website and I have following questions:</p>
<p>1. How can you be certain that what you are seeing in reality is what is and the one and only true what is? And how can you be sure your reality is correct and others are in falsehood? Is it possible to be aware in different levels of awareness or different realities?</p>
<p>2. Your teaching seems to verify or confirm for yourself. How are we ordinary people be able to verify what you see when we cannot see what is? In other words, how can we know you are enlightened?</p>
<p>Also I have following question: you mentioned that you reached enlightenment at 1984 when you are 44. Can you tell us what was the inner voice that you heard when you count back the years? What was this consciousness that you are connecting to and how is it different from other consciousness such as Buddha, Christ, ordinary people, or another dead soul ? What level dimension is your conscious relative to Buddha and are how many levels of conscious are above you?</p>
<p>Also, what is the purpose of life? of the universe? of what is? </p>
<p>Can you briefly describe how are people's view of reality different from yours? For example, when you see an orchid flower, what do you see?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael</p>
