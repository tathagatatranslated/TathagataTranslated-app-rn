<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Alex</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>If a soldier shoots and kills someone what affect will that have on his/hers karma ? And secondly I believe in everything you say but like nearly every other person I can't understand the principle under which you say it, so where could I meet you if possible?</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Alex</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>To shoot a person dead as soldier is done by a command, so it doesn't affect big the soldier's mental thought. Whenever, it's very natural to aim at enemy and to be ready to fire because if a soldier doesn't fire in a war, the one has to give up one's life. I've never seen any cases that to capture enemy in an war is crime or sin.</p>
<p>If you visit Malaysia or Korea, you can meet me every time. But I want you to understand that there are a lot of people who say they want to meet me so far, but no one visit me yet.</p>
