<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Mahiralok</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Great work on the webpage. I have a question about meditation, which meditation will improve my brains abilities? </p>
<p>Thanks Mahiralok</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Mahiralok,</p>
<p>Ordinary people don't know well about the structure of the human body. </p>
<p>Even, doctors can't announce the structure and the function of the brain yet. Scientist's are the same. </p>
<p>We need to verify together that someone can improve the function of the brain and make one's life brighter through meditation. </p>
<p>From what I've verified, I want to tell you every meditation was not helpful to people's truthful life in everywhere.</p>
