<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Pamela</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I read your web page. I'm sorry for the life you had to endure. I pray that you will be blessed for the rest of your life. I too have been feeling that something big was about to happen. I have thought and thought on it, and I can feel it in my mind, yet, I can't figure out just what it is, but I told my family that something very big was about to happen. All I could think to do was pray to God to bless our world, and it's people and for each of us to open up our minds to God, and his blessings, and kind loving thoughts, and doing good deeds. I was interested to know what else you had to say about what's to come. If you would like to share some of the information with me, then I would feel honored. Well, thanks for reading my email. God bless you. </p>
<p>Pamela</p>
