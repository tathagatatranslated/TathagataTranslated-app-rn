<p>Dear Kong KC, </p>
<p>I have not found any merits in the current Buddhism.That's why I do not have any particular interests in it or in its teachings. Moreover I have not met any kinds of Buddhism which convey Buddha's teachings as they really are. Therefore I am reluctant to define how they contribute to human societies. If you intend to do something to bless yourself and others through your life you are welcomed to contact us anytime. Then I may give you all the answers to what you are wondering. </p>
<p>Because the levels of consciouness of Buddha and Jesus were beyond those of humans they could see lots of things that humans were not able to realise or see. And they tried to teach people what they had realised. However I could not find any of ground that they came from the other space. We can divide into a few dimensions that consciouness can stay and I am sure they came from the different dimension where are 3-4 higher than the ordinary people'. </p>
<p>answer continued </p>
<p>about UFO </p>
<p>I find that this is not right time to answer to this question. </p>
<p>In order to answer I need a very accurate question. However I have not found any concrete proof of the appearance of UFO or of controller for it. I have met people who claimed that they had seen UFO but their words were verified as falsehood in the process of confirmation. </p>
<p>What I teach for my members for the first step is the principle of how the world has been determined. Secondly I am trying to let them know how the world is operated. I say that if people become to understand these two anybody will be able to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>Even though I have been to Singapore I have not met anyone who I could converse.</p>
