<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Vanessa</p>
<p>There are so many people who are suffering like you in this world. I hope that you write to me again after searching more concrete facts. When a man has a secret love affair he might have several reasons. So you need to ask your husband about your worries and doubts so that you can confirm his thoughts and plan. For example, 'why do you like her?' or 'if you become love her more and more will you leave me?' etc.. Without the concrete facts the Enlightened being cannot give any abstract answer.</p>
