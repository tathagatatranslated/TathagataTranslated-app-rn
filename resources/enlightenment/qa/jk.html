<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From JK</h3><p>Dear Tathagata,</p><p>What is the difference, if any, between what you think of as good and what you think of as evil ? Is evil simply that which locks us into destructive cycles like hatred ? More importantly, I want to understand what you mean by love. I have my own ideas about it, but I can not know for certain if they are correct.</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>JK</p><p>Answer from Tathagata</p><p>Dear JK,</p><p>There is truth where goodness is, and there is lies where evil is. The truth of goodness and evil can be recognized by whether what they speak is true or not . </p>
<p>Love is something that becomes a blessing to an object. </p><p>Tathagata</p><p>Further response from JK</p><p>Dear Tathagata,</p><p>Thank you for your words. There is so much wisdom in them. I do not doubt that you are what you call yourself. I am happy to accept that. I value your words.</p><p>However, I feel that I should be searching for my own path to life, or enlightenment, or whatever it is that I am searching for. Can this way be correct? Do you think that discarding all teachings and establishing my own would lead me on a good path? I feel like it is important that I do things this way because this way I will truly understand what I am learning. </p><p>The problem is that I do not even know what I am looking for. I do not know if I am even looking for anything. I feel like I am in a giant dark room and can not find my way.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>JK</p><p>Answer from Tathagata</p><p>Dear JK</p><p>I would like to answer your question by an example. If someone wants to get pears after planting an apple tree, it will be no more than his dream. If you want to bear the pears despite you are an apple tree you should go to the people who get pears from the apple tree and check the process. If you have those wisdom you can do it. If not, you should realise that it is impossible for you to get pears from the apple tree.</p><p>Tathagata</p><p>Further response from JK</p><p>Dear Tathagata,</p><p>I thank you very much for answering all my questions so far. Your words are invaluable. I just wanted to know if you wanted to explain where and what gravity is exactly. I cannot understand why such a force exists or where it is. </p><p>Thank you so much,</p>
<p>JK</p><p>Further reply from Tathagata</p><p>Dear JK, </p><p>There is energy in the air on earth, which is essencial for rebirth of life. And we call it as gravity. The gravity is created by the activities of everything in the world. </p><p>Tathagata</p><p>Further response from JK</p><p>Dear Tathagata,</p><p>I have another question: have you ever read the Diamond Sutra? It is supposed to be a recorded conversation between the Buddha Shakyamuni and some Subhuti, but this has never been verified. Can you verify if what is stated in it is true? I would really appreciate it. </p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>John</p>
