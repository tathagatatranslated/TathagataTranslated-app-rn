<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Ian,</p>
<p><U>How do you know that what you perceive as the truth is the truth and that all the other enlightened beings are wrong ?</U></p>
<p>Anybody can realize it after verifying what is. However, if I explain mathematics to someone who doesn't learn mathematics, then they will have many misjudgments and difficulty to understand.</p>
<p><U>Why do you think that you have been selected for enlightenment and no other ?</U></p>
<p>For attaining Enlightenment, first we have to know courage and conscious, and secondly, endless love should be inside us. But the love that I speak of is not a love between lovers and not a love by sexual desire but the love is a teaching that can bless others and the world. Therefore, if I see others' actions or listen to their words I can recognize immediately how they deceive people and whether their teaching is helpful for the world or not. However, I've never seen and met anyone whos teaching is a blessing to others or the world so far.</p>
<p><U>What can you impart to the world in a free and giving way, that can help humanity to improve it's lot ?</U></p>
<p>That's right. If and whenever I could find people who are very interested in the truth, I will always solve their doubt. But I couldn't find people who were interested in the truth anywhere in the world. If you verify my teachings or words, you can verify them from everywhere. Therefore, if you tell me various informations that you have, I will tell you such a matter brings what result in the world and in your life and to others. </p>
