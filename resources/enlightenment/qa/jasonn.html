<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Jason N</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>Firstly I'd like to say although I am not 100% certain that you are who you say you are, I am still optimistic. Your picture depicts a man who seems completely at peace, what you speak is profound, and after reading your biography, your enlightenment does seem completely logical, as only a truly extraordinary person could encounter and counteract such circumstances.</p>
<p>I would like to ask one question though, without trying to sound too pedantic. Buddhist monks, since Siddharta's enlightenment, are only in possession of one or two items of clothing, significantly a robe. Without trying to sound materialistic, why is it that you don seemingly expensive suits. I know this is a crazy question to ask, but in some ways, only from what I have read, it does some quite ironic for a man of your position. I'm not in any way denouncing you but I would be intrigued at your answer.</p>
<p>I have another question as well regarding your views on the end of the world. I can understand that you must have an enormous burden to carry as you can envision the truth behind it, and im not even expecting an answer back to this question due to the secrecy you hold behind it, but I was just wondering if it has anything to do with the Mayan 2012 prophecy. From the way I perceive things, although it may only be because I have only been more intricately aware of the worlds problems recently, I do sense that things are getting worse (although again I may be wrong). 3rd world countries are deteriorating before our eyes, governments continue to lie and ignore their countries although people are now figuring out these corruptions due to liberation of speech, and culture is increasingly becoming more fabricated and dillusioned, particularly in the west, where morality seems to have deteriorated much more than it has done in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>I would be honored if you replied back.</p>
<p>Your sincerely,</p>
<p>Jason</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Jason,</p>
<p>It's a long time since I got such a question that makes me smile. So, I appreciate your question. I bought the coat purely with my money. Therefore, there is no problem and the coat is quite high-grade goods, but I bought it at a low price because where I bought the coat was the factory of the coat. And I don't cause people's sympathy and absolutely don't look down upon people's valuables or such kind of thing through a story that I don't know the same as Buddhist monk. Although I'm always endeavoring for making people awake, I'm a freeman and a freeman can wear short pants in the summer and woolen Western clothes in the winter. Somehow, I'm very glad that you ask this kind of thing of me, I accept your question with pleasure.</p>
<p>I also realize very surprising facts again though the curiousity of your question about the end of the world (Changing period). Everything in the world is repeating in single periodic time, and someone in the history of the Maya said the end of the world will occur in 2012 on the grounds of the periodic time theory. But if one didn't calculate accurately the basis and date in detail and at the moment one predicted with a periodic time theory three thousand or four thousand ago,then it doesn't matter if one knew what one predicted, anyway we can not verify it now but it's predicted very accurately. However, the reason that I add a little time, few years, is I observe very near and one observed from further than me. Therefore, a difference of a few years can exist. The end of the world will occur between 2017 and 2020 in the world. And secondly, why western people are morally ruined is that there are too many things that ordinary people can't understand in the world. So, I'm considering deeply what is good for explaining such matters. We call the consciousness which left from the living body as a ghost. Because this ghost separates from a living body, it doesn't have a body. If a ghost enter a human's body, then they can change the human's character and they show will to fulfill their own corrupted desires and wants and such things. The cause is dead being doesn't enter metempsychosis and therefore exists with having consciousness as a living state. As time goes by, it's getting worse.</p>
