<p>Indu</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Indu,</p>
<p>Karma is what is in your motae (origin) which becomes to exist by what you've done in your past. Love is that you accept something to bless the world and tell for others and practice it. Therefore love is the only key to remove karma and the karma never been vanished without love. This is the relationship of them.</p>
