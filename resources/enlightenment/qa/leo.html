<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Leo</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Hello. I read your website on spiritual enlightenment and wanted to talk to you about my own existence and maybe get some advice. </p>
<p>The final stage in my karma is to reach enlightenment, but there is something important to me that is causing a big obstacle. My thoughts and emotions are attached to someone that has gone from my life and I miss this person very much. </p>
<p>I am stuck and I don't know how to move forward what should I do ? </p>
<p>I also live a solitary life, I've never been truely connected to anything or anyone in this world, I have to rely on myself alot to solve problems. What is the best way to cope with a solitary existence ? </p>
<p>Leo.</p>
<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Leo </p>
<p>Who is the person left you? A woman or a guru...? </p>
<p>If you let me know about the person I can give you my proper advise and guidance. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<p>Further response from Leo</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>It wasn't a lover who left me, just a friend who I care about alot.</p>
<p>I feel angered by the separation and this is the thing that keeps me from being at peace and moving forward.</p>
<p>Leo.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Leo</p>
<p>Meeting or seperating, both of them happen due to karma. </p>
<p>When your karma of it become to vanished you will seperate from someone.Meanwhile when your new karma arise you will meet new one. </p>
<p>Do not care of it. Your understanding and judgement to accept this are more important.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
