<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Barbara</h3>
<p>Tathagata. </p>
<p>I have read the information on your web site. If I understand correctly you went to the island and achieved enlightenment in 1984 this lifetime. </p>
<p>I also understand that your prediction for the end of human existence as it exists at present is to be within 20 years. </p>
<p>I also see that your intent is to be with us in physical body for 18 years. </p>
<p>I respectfully ask if you will please clarify for me, what year you are planning to leave the body. In other words, how much time is left before the end. </p>
<p>As I understand each of us must make a decision regarding our intention and that intention is what will allow each one to continue toward enlightenment. </p>
<p>I realize that my understanding is limited but it is my yearning to know, to see, to be enlightened as well. </p>
<p>Any assistance you can offer me will be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time, for your willingness to answer my questions. </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Barbara</p>
<p>The fixed period for my activity left about seven years. The cycle of the end of human civilization will meet nine years later or twelve years later if it is longer. Everything is in reality but you do not realise them. </p>
<p>That's why it is urgent for you to awake yourself. We will continue to reveal these things on our web site (<a href="www.lifeguide.or.kr">www.lifeguide.or.kr</a>). Pay attention, please.</p>
