<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Chip</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>People and things in this world spontaneously appear. All is here to help guide the way....the way to enlightenment. Everything is a product of mind. There cannot be one thing without having the other, there cannot be white without there being black. A dichotomy of opposites. They are one really, no difference and both exist, in dependence of the other. This is very Taoist.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand your website. Thank you for this site. It helped me know that I am not crazy and what I feel is real. Everything is Karma....everything. To see Samsara is Nirvana and Nirvana as Samsara. Emptiness....mind only. Everything is Mind. There is tremendous purpose to this life, coming so rarely. I believe I am enlightened and welcome testing, and whatever lies ahead for me.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Chip,</p>
<p>If you have attained Enlightenment, I'd like to listen from you what Enlightenment you attained as much as you know. With your answer I can verify whether you attained Enlightenment. Secondly, if you say you attained Enlightenment in any case, I will ask a simple question. Then, if you can answer the question, I will never doubt the assertion that you attained Enlightenment. Though many people say that they attained Enlightenment in the world, after I verified these two processes, no one passed the processes so far. I hope this precedent is helpful for you.</p>

<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Humbly, I feel I am on the quest of Enlightenment and feel as though at times I have reached this. I was hoping for some questions from you which through my email conversations, I may have already answered. I am not sure and feel this is of the utmost importance. Please help me confirm what I feel I know. You said you have a couple of questions you can ask to confirm or disprove my hypothesis. </p>
<p>I thought you were going to ask me questions to verify enlightenment ?</p>

<p>Further reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Chip,</p>
<p>If we solve single question all, there is only one answer. But if we talk about Enlightenment while we are in a state that we can not recognize a problem, simply say it's very nonsensical thing and if we understand it as good side, it is just a comedy. When someone can recognize things in the world and open one's eye of recognizing ability, we can say one as an enlightened being, but I told you previously that I was curious what you can recognize. If you tell me what you want me to ask you, I will ask you immediately and in the question I can answer you that whether how much your Enlightenment and yourself can be helpful for the world or not.</p>

<p>Further Response from Chip</p>
<p>Venerable Tathagata,</p>
<p>I am anxiously awaiting a response from you, as I am curious about myself. It seems you want direct questions without ambiguity and I hope I am able to do this with the ineffable.</p>
<p>1. I would like to know if I am enlightened. </p>
<p>2. If I am enlightened, this is an achievement of a Buddha and I wonder which Buddha I am?</p>
<p>3. We live in a very degenerate age and believe these are times of a Buddha, particularly Buddha Vajarasattava, am I him?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and gracious contemplation.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Chip,</p>
<p>I heard well what you sent me from my disciples reading. You said you practiced Buddha's teaching. I've met many intellectual but I've never met any Buddha's teaching anywhere in the world. Then where is the Buddha's teaching that you've got ? Did you heard them directly from Buddha or others ? I like to ask about that. Secondly, you said you practiced Buddha's teaching and from what I can see there is no one who knows Buddha's teaching but how can you practice it by yourself ? Third, in the case of you attained Enlightenment, then you don't need to follow and sell other's teaching or Buddha's teaching because you observe by yourself and inform what you saw to others. But you didn't attain Enlightenment for sure and I think you don't know any information on how to attain Enlightenment. You have to explain how you have such ability of the Enlightenment through some method but you didn't explain anything about that. So, I have to say like this. And through Enlightenment, people practice the way of Buddha and our society is supposed to be the only place to teach the necessary way for practicing the way of Buddha. Therefore, I wonder about where and how you learned it. And if you are born with them because of your virtue in the past, you should be a very superior person all around you and you should show many marvel to people so far. Your business can be best of the business circles but I couldn't read that you worked for some business with your ability and then you were the best of the business circles in short time. I see various conditions, I like to tell you that you couldn't wake yourself up from illusion and if you don't want to listen what I tell you, I like to ask this. In the world, there are many words but when you execute some word, the definition of the word should exist. If you attained Enlightenment and you send me what is the definition of the Enlightenment next time, I will verify things in what you tell me. Then, if I verify whether you can see, what I point out from what you say, the identity in yourself will be exposed.</p>
