<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Joyce Wright</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>1. Have others recognized you as being an incarnation of Tathagata, Buddha? Have Tibetan monks recognized you? I read that you visited Tibetan monks.</p>
<p>2. Also, do people come to meet you and learn from you ? Where do they meet you ? What do you teach ? And, what methods to enlightenment would you teach me specifically ?</p>
<p>Joyce </p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Joyce,</p>
<p>1. There was no one in the world who knew my past and my past achievements. </p>
<p>And there was also no one who recognized and welcomed me as Buddha. </p>
<p>I'm not living for any of honour and fame but I'm living for leaving beautiful myself in the world. </p>
<p>So, it's not a big matter to me that somebody recognizes me.</p>
<p>2. I've done a lot of activities. During the time, I met few people who sympathize with my teaching . So, I meet them in my house and my teaching is to guide people to the world of truth. Truth exists in reality and to make people enlighten and see is my mission. If people can see things in reality, a bad man can be a good man. And it's easy to be a bad man from good man whom can not see things in reality. There is a way for enlightenment but I only teach it for a man who has enthusiasm for enlightenments. In case that you show me your real will in front of me, I will teach you all of the secret of that.</p>

<p>Further Response from Joyce</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I do believe in enlightenment. I don't currently know Tibetan yoga or other practices because they are secret and only given to initiates within the Buddhist orders. I do have teachings from some enlightened teachers. I don't know what you have to teach about enlightenment as you don't speak about things that you see or know which is what an enlightened teacher usually does...they see and know all...but go ahead and please share wisdom if you have something to teach me and the world. Perhaps you are born simply to realize a level of vibration to uphold it for the world and not to teach this lifetime and I respect that in you as well as in others too, as no one is a teacher but all are interconnected in the oneness.</p>

<p>Further Reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Joyce,</p>
<p>I can neither recognize which master you met before nor trust your words and mail. Because you didn't present any evidences which can prove their enlightenment. So far, I've traveled a lot of countries and met many people, famous people, some people who say they attained enlightenment. And I've met almost superior Guru in the world but I've never met someone who attained enlightenment or who know how to attain enlightenment. When I meet people, I ask them of simple question. I asked that they can recognize things in our life or not but the result was no one answered my question. If you're going to have interest with my answer and verify, there will be a teaching for you.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
