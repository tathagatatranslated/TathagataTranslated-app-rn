<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Craig</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Many people on the internet are forecasting a dire financial collapse that may even be worldwide. What is your assessment of the economic situation ? Is such a collapse likely to happen ? </p>
<p>Also, you state on your message that you can introduce the best method for curing illness that will be the method used in the future world. </p>
<p>What is the method and how can people do it ? </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>Craig.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>Because of development of mechanism humans become losing their own roles. In fact, there were lots of things to make good money in everywhere in the world at least five years ago. But I cannot find them now even with my sharp eyes. People's forecast are not much wrong. The world will be suffered by a severe financial collapse in the near future. Politicians use something very higher mathematics. They usually use a kind of fraud policy because it is helpful for them to maintain their power and popularity. However they do not take any responsibility for the result. Many of questions that we can not understand will be solved within ten years from now on. </p>
<p><A NAME="uitong"></A>Uitong is the ability that an extremely pure being obtains, whose soul is absolutely free from the attachments and all of the desires. </p>
<p>When I touch the body of a patient with my hand my strong energy neutralizes poison which causes illness. If the poison is very strong I destroy it by the spiritual operation. I connect on their consciousness and trace their pain. When I find the causes of disease I simply destroy them. People need quite a training and self-cultivation. People cannot get this from thoughts or desires. It is possible for them to get this through listening, seeing and experiencing from me. </p>

<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>You said people can obtain the ability of Uitong &quot;through listening, seeing and experiencing from me.&quot; </p>
<p>What kinds of things can they hear, see and experience? </p>
<p>What do they learn from this? </p>
<p>What kind of changes take place in a person after they have done this? </p>
<p>How can these changes give them the ability to have Uitong? </p>
<p>Thankyou, </p>
<p>Craig.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>Uitong is the best medicine that has existed in legend. After I got 'uitong' I checked some record but I did not find anyone who used it. However uitong existed in a long long years ago and handed down. In order to get uitong you need an enlightenment and training later. You should let your energy go out and come in freely and need more than 90% purity of your energy. That's why it is impossible for people to understand this without staying near me. They should see by themselves. I met many of healers during my frequent travel and I confirmed that they could not heal themselves and others as well.</p>

<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>When you say there will be an economic collapse in the near future, do you mean in weeks, months or a few years? </p>
<p>Do you think that the banks and the food supply will be affected? </p>
<p>Do you advise people to find somewhere in the country away from large heavily populated cities and to store food etc ? </p>
<p>Thankyou, </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>Well, nowadays,everywhere in the world , some people who work in the area of politics and economics are very tricky. Therefore the probability of financial crisis is 99% and it will come within one or two years of time if things go with this pace. The roles of human beings become less. In this situation starvation is inevitable in greater part of the world. </p>
