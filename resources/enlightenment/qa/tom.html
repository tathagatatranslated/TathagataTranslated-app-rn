<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Tom</h3>
<p>Sir, </p>
<p>Do you believe that the third eye can be opened by the other world and can you describe the experience? </p>
<p>Tom.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Tom</p>
<p>The third eye is formed rather than be opened in my view.</p>
<p>It comes into being in someone's body who loves the world forever after attaining a perfect enlightenment. This one appears in the world once every 6,000 to 10,000 year period of time. </p>
<p>That's why there's been no proof that any other methods or practices can create the third eye.</p>

<p>Dear Tathagata</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply, I wish to ask you now,in private, of an experience following suffering when I called out for guidance. Within minutes cold air, as if blown through a straw marked an elliptical pattern of dots around by front temple, first one way then another. Can you explain this. </p>
<p>Kind regards </p>
<p>Tom.</p>
<p>Dear Tom </p>
<p>Your experience is one of numerous phenomena that people see when they contact spirits. Would you tell me your experience more concretely and precisely? When I know exactly about what happened to you I can give you the correct answer. It can happen because of karma of the spirit or because of your physical structure.</p>
