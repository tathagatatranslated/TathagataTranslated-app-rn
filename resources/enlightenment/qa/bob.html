<p>So, WHY ?</p>
<p>Bob</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Bob,</p>
<p>I do not believe that I can save the world. Things in the world have been determined in the process which the world was formed. People can save themselves on their own if they become to know it . I have been trying to tell them what had been determined but nobody wants to learn properly. I do this alone as no one can do this except me. </p>
