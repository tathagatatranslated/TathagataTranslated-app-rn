<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Pol Shappy</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I recently found the website of a man who claimed to have originally done work to help create the new world after the changing period. His name was Gahng Jeung-san, and his title is Sahng-jeh-nim... during his</p>
<p>life, he wrote this book called The Sacred Book of Dao. He died sometime around 1909.</p>
<p>It appears to me like this man had an enlightenment similar to that of Jesus. Can you confirm this for me?</p>
<p>There is a website created by one of his followers. It's available in Korean, so you can read it without a translation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Pol</p>
<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Pol,</p>
<p>I have been tried to know what did he do really but I could not find any way to confirm any facts in what he said. In this reason I absolutely do not see him as a man who opened his eye to the world. So, I request you to check on your own why he has so many followers. Because I find it very hard to tell you, a foreigner, what I have seen and known about him. </p>
<p>Good teaching must be in the reality but I cannot see any actual thing in his words. That's why I believe that he was the blind or an extreme idealist.</p>

<p>Further Respose from Pol</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I appreciate your response so much. I'd like to say that of all the people in the world, I believe it is a person like me who can appreciate the burden you carry. You see, throughout my life I've always had a big interest in truth. Whenever people have come to me with questions or problems or pain, I always knew exactly here the problem lied, but nobody wanted to listen to what I was saying. Some people made fun of me and some people began spreading lies about my heart or even about truth itself. I saw so many prophets of the past and wise people in the current time. However, none of these people (except Gautama Buddha) had succeeded in really revealing themselves as who they were. I began to feel that it was because of that, that they had failed. I felt that all the wise people around me were similar to me, but none of them had good enough karma to see the importance of truth. My thoughts turned to Shakyamuni, and I felt my life was so much like his. Last september, I had an experience that fits your description of enlightenment. However, the difference that I've noticed is that while I was able instantly answer things in truth, it was as if I had to teach my way out of my mind by removing my karma. With the appearance of Maitreya Buddha, and his demonstration of the way to knowing the world, I knew what I had to do with my life. In exactly the same way that I preached to the various elements of my karma, I had to reveal myself in the world as the same person. As I began to do so, people began to listen to what I had to say, some could accept it, and some could even understand it. However, nobody could accept any description of me. In recent days, I'm </p>
<p>beginning to realize the importance of introducing myself from the very beginning. Because of that, I know what I must do.</p>
<p>Like you say, the world is my teacher. So, if there are any kinds of questions you would like to ask me in order to confirm anything, I can answer them.</p>
<p>Answer From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Pol,</p>
<p>You said that you have realised a truth in the world. </p>
<p>I would like to hear your answer to my questions. </p>
<p>Where is the truth? </p>
<p>What do you indicate by the term of truth?</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>By Truth, I mean the world. By truths, I mean the facts of the world... For example, there is the 'truth' of a fact and there are falsehoods about that fact.</p>
<p>There are numerous means of opening one's eyes to truth, and the Tathagata uses those numerous means to teach people according to what they need to hear.</p>
<p>For example, the Tathagata speaks about 'truth' and 'falsehood' because humans are considering things in terms of 'truth' and 'falsehood', but the true nature of phenomena is not concerning 'true' and 'false'.</p>
<p>Further, the Tathagata speaks about the principle of rebirth. Although what he is saying is true, the principle itself was conceived of by the Tathagata as a way to cause people to understand the Truth (the world). Another example is the Tathagata's teaching of eternal life...although the Tathagata speaks about removing one's karma to get eternal life, that's a way to cause people to progress and come to see the principle.</p>
<p>Dear Pol</p>
<p>I have one son. What do I need for changing him into a good man ? I would like to hear your opinion.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
<p>Further Response from Pol</p>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>You need the way to change your son a good man. First, you should</p>
<p>teach about the fundamental principle in the world, so that he can </p>
<p>become aware of his life and motae. Second, you should explain to him</p>
<p>about conscience and justice for love. Third, you should ask Mr.</p>
<p>Shappy for the way. After he reveals the way, your son can became a</p>
<p>good man. </p>
<p>Reply From Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Pol</p>
<p>I want to know your ablilty what you can teach people. One day, I asked three question of young children. If you can answer one of them, I will ask you. But before that, I want to listen what you say and then I will verify what you can see. After that, I'm going to deny your word or I will listen your word with trust. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
