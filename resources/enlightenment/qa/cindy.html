<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Cindy</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata </p>
<p>I see the present bad state of the world and often fall into deep depression, because I am so disappointed about peoples wrong behavior and attitudes. I find it hard to see any good in the world and I just see greed, dishonesty and deceitfulness. I just live each day as it comes and I find it very hard to motivate myself to do anything as I am always struggling against bad people. I run a business which sells other businesses, however the people who want to sell their business always want to exaggerate the facts and figures also - and if I refuse then they take their business elsewhere. So my question is - is it wrong for me to exaggerate things in order to get more business and be successful - or would I be deceiving people ? </p>
<p>Thank You Cindy</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Cindy</p>
<p>If you have to agony about this, I believe that your conscience still works. Isn't it a normal desire of human beings that he estimates highly of the value or merit of his possessions? Virtually, this is business. So when you introduce something to a purchaser ,say to him.-&quot;A seller says like this about it. If you are serious why don't you confirm what the seller says?&quot; Of course, you should advise carefully. It will depends on who do you deal with.</p>
<p>Afterall, what you pointed out is a sort of habitual practice,so we can not say it is good or bad. This is obviously a cheating on legal sense, but people always speak of their best days. What can you do as a middleman? So, you don't need to worry about this problem because you are just a middleman and your role is to convey what a seller says. It's up to a purchaser to verify and judge the conditions. </p>
