<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Matthew</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I do not doubt in any way that you have had a profound experience. But many people are out there in the world and are like you. So my question to you is how are you different than my Rinzai Zen teachers or any other spiritual or enlightened being ? I have been training in Rinzai Zen since 1998. I am a senior student and ours is a lineage that dates back 2500 years to the Buddha. I feel very fortunate to have found my &quot;karmic&quot; home so to say.</p>
<p>No offense, but in what I read on your website you act as if you are the only one out there who has had their third eye open. For some reason I highly doubt that to be the case. I read and understand very well where you are coming from. I too have gone through deep experiences and know that this training NEVER ends. It goes from one life to the next...we live in some form or another for as long as the Universe allows itself to exist.</p>
<p>The world needs more people like you though...it really does. In fact that is one of the things that comes to me that is from the True Self--that more Spiritual Teachers need to get out there more and share their experiences more with the world in order to &quot;wake everybody up.&quot; It is to bad that you have not been able to lecture here in the United States. If you ever make it out here please let me know. I would be more than willing to be in attendance with my teachers in tow. Thank you for your time and consideration. Take care and have a nice day.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Matthew M. Rutkowski</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Matthew,</p>
<p>By making contact with gods and dead souls, the spiritual master whom you are talking about tells people about what living people can not see. And the difference between a spiritual master and me is what I'm informing to people. I don't get any information from a dead being and I let people know what I saw by myself and what is in reality. Therefore, I suggest the way that people can make themselves realize through what I inform them. That's why, a spiritual teaching taught from making contact with dead souls is not helpful and is not a blessing for Enlightenment and future yourself. And to make people realize by one's experience and observation gives benefit to the teacher and learner in the future and present. It means both the teacher and learner receive a very good result. It's true that the point is definitely different. It looks the same but there is a difference as wide as the poles.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
