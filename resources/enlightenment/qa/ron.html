<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Ron </p>
<p>If you want to learn how to read you should learn from somebody who knows letters. You should pass a few courses in order to see the world like me. First of all you need to know the way to see the world. You don't have to think this too much difficult. Let's take mathematics as an example. What kind of teaching and learning can make you to create and solve the mathematical questions ? If you think this question you may find a good idea. If you don't find any idea ask me again. </p>
<p>Because I do not teach meditation I don't know why people have to practice meditation. I know that there are lots of people who have experienced very dangerous things through meditation. </p>
<p>You were born by the causes and occasions of the activities of the world. In short, you are a creature of the world. The world can not exist inside of you. And your effort and ability will decide how much you do understand and embrace this world. </p>
<p>Who is the God and why it want to live in poor humans' body ? You might understand it if you think this issue with common sense. That is just a fable that was made by liars. And 'Heaven is within you' means that the way to the heaven is created by what is in you. </p>

<p>Further response from Ron</p>
<p>Sir, Of course one should go to an expert in any field chosen.<br/>
Truth is often simple.<br/>
Can you tell me how to see as you do?<br/>
Maybe describe what it is like?<br/>
I sense you feel like an island<br/>
I might be wrong<br/>
Maybe you feel the Oneness.<br/>
Connection brings Joy<br/>
You do not seem joyful<br/>
again, I may be wrong.<br/>
Thank you for returning to assist.<br/>
I find it hard to believe&quot;no one else wanted to come&quot;<br/>
as you said... what are three things most important to you, sir please?<br/>
Perhaps some will understand if there is more description<br/>
of what we are and what we are not<br/>
Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Further reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Ron,</p>
<p>When I see the things I see them as they are. </p>
<p>People have very different points of view because they have different motae. That's why many of saints who came to the human world were killed. They should have said more carefully. But people can realise that they committed sin only after when those saints were killed. People understand what saints said were true only after their death. </p>
<p>I also have spent lots of time in agony to find out a solution for the problem of difference of view between human beings and me. And finally I understood that was the evidences. People had to accept what I said was true as I showed them the perfect evidence but they looked away because they didn't like it. Good wins evil-it is right in only theory. But in reality a good person can be killed by a stronger robber. In human history unrighteousness have prevailed over righteousness.</p>
