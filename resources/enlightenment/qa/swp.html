<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From SWP</h3>
<p>Master Tathagata, </p>
<p>Experiencing great knowledge by Lucid dream, would you say that you had <br/>
some experiences of it too time to time? </p>
<p>Sincerly, </p>
<p>S.W.P.</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear SWP,</p>
<p>I seldom dream unlike ordinary people, so I don't have any experience that you have got. You dream less when you are more healthy.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
