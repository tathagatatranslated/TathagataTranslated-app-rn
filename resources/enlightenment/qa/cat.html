<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Cat</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Subject: Enlightenment Teacher</p>
<p>I am interested in finding an enlightenment teacher. I didn't know that I could request one. I was always told that when I am ready, a teacher will come. </p>
<p>I desire only to become enlightened. Earthly desires have lost their meaning to me.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Cat,</p>
<p>There is nothing to be done without relation. Therefore, a result of good thing or bad thing is just different by relation. And if you really want to attain Enlightenment and I can meet you while I'm alive, I can answer all of parts of what you want to know. I've travelled countless places in the world for 20 years and wherever I went, I met many Guru who guided people and the people said their Guru is enlightened being but there was no Guru who answered what I asked them of things in the present. So, there was no one who attained Enlightenment but almost them used dead souls. I found that dead souls usually gathered where people gathered and at famous places.</p>
