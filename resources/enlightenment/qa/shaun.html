<p>Awaiting Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Shaun</p>
<p>1) Anybody can be free from karma when they are enlightened.</p>
<p>2) Although I can't say that I can see the past or the future, when I see things in reality I know what problem caused them. Things in the world keep going by the problems in themselves.That's why I can see the answer for a certain question.</p>
<p>3) Your question is not so clear.</p>
<p>There are some creatures that will come to be disappeared while some will live forever. It depends on individual's life itself and it's own relations. That's why I can not answer until I see the problems that everybody has got. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
