<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Erki</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I wanted to know if you are faimiliar with the literature of Vladimir Megre and the thoughts of Anastasia.</p>
<p>Erki</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata,</p>
<p>Dear Erki,</p>
<p>I've looked for and met most of this kind of people who are famous. </p>
<p>However, when I see records that these famous people left it was impossible to prove if the records were true or not because the contents of their teachings were not to put problems first or examples (to make problems or examples as prime object) but to make words using logic. </p>
<p>First of all, if you explain to me about who you are talking about and what teachings they contributed to human society then I can answer your question more acurately.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
