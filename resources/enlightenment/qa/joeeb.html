<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Joe,</p>
<p>I know how people make themselves realize by which process and I know which thing can make people realize. I can teach you the way but it depends on you whether you accept that. In case you accept my word, first you will be the most superior philosopher in the world. However, if you don't accept my word and deny it, I will not be able to teach you any teaching.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
