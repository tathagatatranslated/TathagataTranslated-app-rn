<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Hubble</h3>
<p>Dear enlightened one, </p>
<p>I don't know how often you check your email or how it is filtered but I really need to talk to you in person or on the phone about the future. You think you are the only one who has experienced supreme enlightenment but it occured to me (a few months ago) at the age of 24. However, I am an atheist. I know my entire destiny and how I will change the world. I have been infused with the TRUTH and know everything that science can't answer. My first book will be coming out in august and I think I can help you get your ideas more clearly out to the world. You seem to be having problems communicating your messsage and I want to help because I know the truth too and I know where your coming from. </p>
<p>Sincerely, Hubble</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Hubble,</p>
<p>Thanks for your will and concerning very much. But I've met a lot of people while I've spent a lot of time for travel. I met almost every famous people who called themselves as an enlightened being. But no one recognizes things in the world. Opening one's eye to reality is enlightenment. But if not to see reality, that enlightenment is needed to verify again.</p>
