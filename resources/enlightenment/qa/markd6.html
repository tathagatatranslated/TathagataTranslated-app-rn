<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Mark</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>

<p>I Saw your website. Have some questions to ask you on some zen koan as below. </p>
<p>Below is one zen koan by one enlightened master.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I practise Zen, I saw mountains as mountains, and waters as waters. </p>
<p>When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not mountains, and waters are not waters. </p>
<p>But now that I have got its very substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again as mountains, and waters once again as waters.&quot;</p>
<p>What is your explanation ? </p>
<p>Second question :- </p>
<p>Buddha held a flower to his thousands of disciples. No disciples understand what Buddha means, but Mahayaspa give a smile meaning he understand. Do you understand what it means ? </p>
<p>Thank you for your kind attention.</p>
<p>Best rgds </p>
