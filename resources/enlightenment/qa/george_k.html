<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From George K</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata, </p>
<p>I have come across your website on the internet, and at first I was </p>
<p>surprised to have seen such a being who claims to be an enlighted person. </p>
<p>Today there are many who claims to be gurus, saints, svamis, spiritual teachers </p>
<p>and so on and on. And everyone says that he's a bona-fide spiritual master. </p>
<p>They attract young and unexperienced people who then became their desciples. </p>
<p>All those teachers support their teachings with so-called holy scriptures, </p>
<p>but sometimes it seems that all that brings about more chaos in human minds </p>
<p>than goodness. I wonder whether in your travels have you ever encountered a </p>
<p>person or spiritual masters of whom you could tell : yes,it seems that this master </p>
<p>is a real one who knows truth,who can be called 'enlightened', and whose teachings </p>
<p>are worth to be recommended to others. I don't want to speak about those others </p>
<p>as dishonest persons ( I rather do not use such expressions), but I would rather say </p>
<p>about them as not knowing the truth, and if someone is away from the truth then </p>
<p>how can he/she teach others.But, unfortunately, it happens very often and in the </p>
<p>end a lot of disciples end their ways mislead and in still worse circumstances than </p>
<p>in the beginning. And here we 've got a problem of today's world : you say </p>
<p>in your teachings that it is an important thing to be aware of the way </p>
<p>the mind works (in conjunction with the karma that influences the mind), </p>
<p>and be aware of the fact that doing right things strengthen our inner </p>
<p>potential, whereas doing bad things leads us into ignorance and away from </p>
<p>enlightenment by which we can free ourselves from the bondage of </p>
<p>ignorance and of the influence of karma. In that case, can you point to </p>
<p>any so-called religious scriptures that, according to your knowledge, could be </p>
<p>beneficial for all of us, and could you point to any sort of religious environment </p>
<p>(I mean Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, for example, along with their 'holy </p>
<p>scriptures') as a poit of referrence (for truth) in the spiritual path? </p>
<p>This has been quite a long question and it may appear too complicated, so once </p>
<p>again : what , according to you, is the spiritual condition of humankind today after </p>
<p>already more than two thousand years of Christianity, after almost three thousand </p>
<p>years since the Buddha Gautama tought of his enlightenment, after around thirteen/ </p>
<p>fourteen (depends on how we calculate the this period) centuries since Mohammed, </p>
<p>the messenger of Allah, revealed Koran ( by the way, what is your thinking in this </p>
<p>subject_who was Koran revealed by?), and so on. </p>
<p>There are many spiritual teachers who constantly want their disciples to repeat </p>
<p>various mantras as a means of liberating the selfs from their karma and a means of </p>
<p>reunion (yoga, communion) with the Supreme God. ( At this point I would like to </p>
<p>ask you to clarify to me your understanding of God, if this is not a trouble to you, </p>
<p>of course). It would be a very precious thing to hear from you on this matter, for </p>
<p>all of us who I hope will be able to see my questions on their computers and, </p>
<p>of course your answers. </p>
<p>In other words, people devote many of their time and energy to practice this or another </p>
<p>form of religion. But , do you see any good arising out of that or maybe, do you think </p>
<p>the progress on this path is very slow or none? </p>
<p>Note: In case you would like to answer my question, you do not have to quote this </p>
<p>email in whole, as it has been so far regarding other's people questions (it seems that </p>
<p>they were cited in whole). You may extract a problem and answer it the way you </p>
<p>think is the best. </p>
<p>Thank you for your attention, </p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear George,</p>
<p>I have not encountered anyone who has known the Truth. </p>
<p>I have not heard any teaching that I wanted to recommend.</p>
<p>As far as I understand there is no religious scripture that is helpful to people. </p>
<p>Today we do not have any religion that is helpful to people alive. </p>
<p>Someone who says about reunion with God does not know the world. That's why you should confirm what do they name by the word 'God' ? </p>
<p>Since everything in the world has been determined all of the answers exist in their problems. I could not find anything good in the problems that they showed except something bad. If a man who does not have strong will meets with those bad people he will experience the same phenomenon of having a narcotic. And it is difficult to be free from the poisoning. This is also the fact that is determined. </p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
