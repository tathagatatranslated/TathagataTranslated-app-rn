<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear James,</p>
<p>In order to give my answers to any questions about the things in the world , it is important for me to understand the matter first. If you want to open the third eye, first of all you 'd better to know if you have that possibility or not. In order to open the third eye, first, the third eye has to be formed, and in order to make the eye to be formed, there has to be a huge effort in oneself for thousands and thousands of years.</p>
