<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Pankaj,</p>
<p>It is a very difficult thing to everyone to find and to reach the destination without knowing the way. For attaining enlightenment, first of all, we should know the way of the enlightenment. But you look like you've never learned and heard from anyone yet. If you attain enlightenment, every karma in yourself will disappear that's why you will be free from evil passions and delusions. After that you can always live in peace.</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
