<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Stanley,</p>
<p>Everything in the world has been determined. I have to listen from you what is falun dafa and how do you practice it. Here is one thing you should know. No one has attained enlightenment by that. What you have to search first of all is that whether falun dafa was said by a god or their words were made by a man. When you find the reality of what I point out ask me again. I will explain them clearly so that you could see instantly.</p>
