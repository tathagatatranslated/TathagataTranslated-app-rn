<p>Nick Jimison</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Nick,</p>
<p>It's truth.</p>
<p>I don't have a help of power from others. I only see what is and distinguish truth and false, and then let people know about that. I always try to inform that people is deceived by what kind of things. In the reality, only one who knows oneself can be helpful to save one's life.</p>
