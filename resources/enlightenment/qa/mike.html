<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Mike</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>I have read with interest your interpretation of the attainment of enlightenment and your own journey, which appears to be very vague.</p>
<p>Why do you believe that you are the only enlightened being and why were you chosen ? Why do you believe that no one else can achieve this state of consciousness ?</p>
<p>The vast majority of human kind are seeking something, happiness ( in the eye of the beholder), personal wealth, possessions etc. For some, the seeking leads to the realization that wealth and possessions, when finally gained, do not fill the void we feel and the realization that there must be more.</p>
<p>You appear to give little or nothing in response to questions regarding the improvement of self and the search for enlightenment ? And I wonder why you feel that you can offer no insight into reaching the enlightened position that you feel you have achieved ?</p>
<p>With Regards,</p>
<p>Mike Luke</p>
<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>Because I fully understand about the world of Enlightenment, I know there is a very rare chance that the one who is the same as me appears in the world. Because the others don't recognize well things in reality, they believe there is a way that anyone can attain the Enlightenment easily. Because of a big difference of sight between me and others, the matter exists.</p>
