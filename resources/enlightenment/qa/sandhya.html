<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Sandhya,</p>
<p>In order to cure your child you should know properly the cause of autism and the method of treatment. The consciousness of your child can not work properly because it is suffered by power of exterior energy . Someone can be cured easily but someone can not. Most of the causes for autism come from the dead souls, when they contact with living people. Therefore autism can not be cured by medicines or medical instruments. Mediums can help but very little probability. That's why I cannot tell you the exact method of treatment until I see your child and check the condition and variety of symptoms of the child. </p>
