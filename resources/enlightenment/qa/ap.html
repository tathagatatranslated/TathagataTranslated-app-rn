<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From AP</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata,</p>
<p>hhmm where do I start? I feel there is no such thing as time only cycles. I also feel everything has an opposite for balance.from material to spiritual to winter and summer. its never summer one day then winter the next, its a cycle and an opposite. I mean all sun and no rain makes for a dry desert. I also feel consciousness works the same way. I feel that people are in the material phase and can't understand or appreciate the deeper truths. I'm not sure but I think there is a universal knowledge, and all of these religions just small parts or basic knowledge for those who cant yet receive the truth. as an enlightened being you should understand that. My question is if everything is a cycle including consciousness, how long have humans been going through these cycles ? I think ancient egyptians knew something. and a side question....what would you say dreams are ? Thanks I would like to talk about many more things with you.</p>

<p>Answer from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear AP,</p>
<p>The cycle depends on the nature of your motae. You need to observe what happens in living reality. Dream is something that is reflected on your consciousness in the state of unconsciousness, but I am not sure how you will understand this. If you ask me again anything you need more explanation I 'd like to try to answer so that you can understand well.</p>
