<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Edward</h3>
<p>Dear Tathagata </p>
<p>I read your website with interest however I am uncertain about some things can you answer. </p>
<p>1) Are you Maitreya Buddha ? </p>
<p>2) If so then this question on your website does not make sense.. </p>
<p>&quot;Shakyamuni Buddha prophesied Maitreya in the future and Jesus as Messiah at the end of the world. Who are Maitreya and Messiah?</p>
<p>&gt; They are the same.&quot; </p>
<p>Please explain this. </p>
<p>3) If I meet someone who claims to be enlightened or to be a buddha then what question can I ask them so they can prove it ? </p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Reply from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Edward,</p>
<p><U>1) Are you Maitreya Buddha ?</U></p>
<p>Do you know what Buddha means? </p>
<p>The next generation will call me as Maitreya Buddha when they understand my life. I say that I attained the Supreme Enlightenment. So I call myself as Tathagata. However I don't say that I myself am a Supreme Master during I stay in the world. Somebody who completes his enlightenment doesn't call himself as Buddha. </p>
<p><U>2) If so then this question on your website does not make sense..(as above)</U></p>
<p>Since the world has been fixed,humans do something to save themselves or not on this rule. </p>
<p>Maitreya or Messiah is designated for a great life of someone who comes to the world in the ending period. Maitreya is to be the greatest teacher and Messiah is to be a savior this world, so they are not the different beings. For example, in Korea when I introduce my wife to others I say &quot;this is my 'anae'.&quot; or &quot;this is my 'manura'.&quot; But she is the same person. </p>
<p>The Messiah will not be able to save the world without excellent wisdom. Maitreya Buddha will not be able to become a Buddha without the greatest wisdom as well. That's why I would like to introduce them as the same person. </p>
<p><U>3) If I meet someone who claims to be enlightened or to be a buddha then what question can I ask them so they can prove it?</U> </p>
<p>Ask them something in reality. If they opened their eye they can see as they are.</p>
