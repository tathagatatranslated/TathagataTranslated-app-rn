<p>In the world, the prophecy that a righteous person would appear in this era has come down from the past. The point that the righteous person is different from ordinary people is that he can perceive the things in the world which nobody has known up until now.</p>
<p class="blue"><a name="mission"></a>What is your mission?</p>
<p>The first one is to help the human world to fulfill their hope. The second one is to reveal the necessary way for transfer from the present mankind to the next.</p>
<p class="blue"><a name="message"></a>What is your message?</p>
<p>Today's world makes many people live in falsehood. Therefore, the revelation of what exists in the world will inform people of the things in truth and falsehood.</p>
<p class="blue"><a name="different"></a>What makes you different from ordinary people?</p>
<p>After attaining the enlightenment, firstly a symbol (the eye of wisdom) has been formed in the center of my forehead. Secondly, Eoi-Tong has occurred to me. Thirdly, I became distant from the five desires. Fourthly, I became able to perceive things in the truth and say them.</p>
<p class="blue"><a name="grow"></a>How did you grow up?</p>
<p>I was born at an isolated and remote cottage located in the Chiri-mountains of southern Korea on 6 April 1942. My family were slash-and-burn farmers. My father was ill, so mother had to take care of all the children by herself. We were so poor that I only managed to survive with the soup of the roots of plants and the barks of trees when I was born. One day, about a few days after I was born, I have been abandoned in the mountains for a while. About a year after I was born, my father passed away. My mother passed away as well when I was 9. From that time on, inevitably, I had to grow up in extreme difficulties where I had to take care of myself without any help from those in my surroundings. Despite this, I began to show outstanding leadership from the age of about 20. When I entered the political world at the age of 25, it caused a big sensation. I got married at the age of 33 and I now have a son and a daughter. I attained the supreme enlightenment at the age of 44 and now, I am here.</p>
