<p>This is the song </p>
            <p>That I used to sing, </p>
            <p>Having seen myself who has no place to go and to stay. </p>
            <p>Heaven, let me find a rightous man today. </p>
            <p>And let the new world be theirs by them. </p>

<p>I was not a man of the people of devil, </p>
<p>But I was the king of good men. </p>
<p>I came through lonely time by myself, </p>
<p>I am wandering and looking for a lover. </p>

<p>Turning round and round is the meaning of creation. </p>
<p>The earth splits, the waterway overturns, </p>
<p>It is the meaning for the survival of the world. </p>
<p>The work that a man with his eyes open has to do is only concern, </p>
<p>The dream of the blind is deep and deep. </p>

<p>I am not guilty however, </p>
<p>Whose is this </p>
<p>Such a fearful mind? </p>
<p>When I pray</p>
<p>With a beautiful meaning, </p>
<p>The world is unkind and unkind. </p>
<p>Having born his cross </p>
<p>up the Golgotha hill, </p>
<p>An innocent man!</p>
<p>I envied you. </p>
<p>I am bearing a big burden, </p>
<p>So I can not desert suffering yet, </p>
<p>My deserted mind is far and far, </p>
<p>But who in the world has known me </p>
<p>In an impatient time? </p>
<p>  </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>Nobody knows my lonely mind, </p>
<p>It dawns and I have no place to go my steps. </p>
<p>I know the greatest treasure in the world, </p>
<p>I am waiting for and finding the owner but there is not. </p>
