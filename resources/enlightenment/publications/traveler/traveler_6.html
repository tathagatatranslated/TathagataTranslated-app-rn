<p>Soyeon.</p>
            <p>This is the first name</p>
            <p>That I gave for the world.</p>
            <p>After having given this name,</p>
            <p>I told her all my secrets.</p>

<p>Soyeon.</p>
<p>A flower </p>
<p>That blooms in a lonely heart.</p>
<p>Does morning dawn</p>
<p>In mind used to be wetted with dew?</p>
<p> You try to bloom yourself</p>
<p>To a ray of light for a bright world,</p>
<p>So I want to fill you with all my wisdom.</p>
<p>I thought a red rose,</p>
<p>I pictured a white lily,</p>
<p>But I wanted to bloom</p>
<p>A small lotus blossom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soyeon.</p>
<p>When you bloomed lonely</p>
<p>For the world,</p>
<p>And when you were</p>
<p>In an agony for the world,</p>
<p>I wanted to call a flower Soyeon</p>
<p>That bloomed</p>
<p>Against such a big suffering.</p>

<p>Meaning of heaven and earth blooms</p>
<p>In human's mind,</p>
<p>The beautiful light</p>
<p>Is fearful and sorrowful indeed.</p>
<p>I saw what happened for thousands of years,</p>
<p>And I was proud of myself,</p>
<p>So I talked to others,</p>
<p>But the wall of mind is high and high.</p>

<p>I </p>
<p>Write a piece of poetry </p>
<p>Here,</p>
<p>Walking the road of suffering.</p>
<p>A man who knows my poem </p>
<p>Opens his eye of soul.</p>
<p>Way is in the world,</p>
<p>Virtue is at the man,</p>
<p>Meeting and separating!</p>
<p>Is there teaching of you?</p>
<p>It is profound.</p>
<p>There is the way of heaven and earth</p>
<p>in the human's mind.</p>

<p>There were three gods mountains in the country of east sea,</p>
<p>Grudge bloomed as a result of five thousand years.</p>
<p>A solitary mind bloomed at that place,</p>
<p>And it let me know the way to the new world.</p>
