  <p align="left">There was no place to dedicate conscience and courage 
again</p>
            <p align="left">In front of the man who has lived in the suffering.</p>
            <p align="left">The solitary song of the man who had to walk along a 
lonely way,</p>
            <p align="left">Because of love toward the fatherland, has passed by 
burning young heart.</p>

<p>The whispering is more beautiful</p>
<p>Than your appearance.</p>
<p>You are the soul</p>
<p>Dedicated to justice for freedom indeed.</p>
<p>Your breath is in the brilliant culture</p>
<p>And attract our attention passing by.</p>
<p>Because you have the dream</p>
<p>That you always want to live peacefully,</p>
<p>The appearance is more beautiful and brilliant.</p>

<p>Let me dream</p>
<p>Peace and love tonight.</p>
<p>Angels sang a song for us,</p>
<p>Human beings built the dream of heaven,</p>
<p>All of us became the savior of the world,</p>
<p>Let me dream such dream.</p>

<p>There is a favor in the world </p>
<p>And the meaning is profound.</p>
<p>Burning my heart  for others,</p>
<p>My mind is shining.</p>
<p>Harmony of heaven and earth being as much as strict,</p>
<p>Cause and occasion of everybody  is different.</p>
<p>When I see a heavy burden by myself,</p>
<p>I feel responsible for all the sins of the world.</p>
