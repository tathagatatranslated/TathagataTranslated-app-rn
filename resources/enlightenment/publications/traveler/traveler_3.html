<p>An innocent man had to see a sin

            <p>Because there was no place to hide his mind,</p>
            <p>He who had to confine himself to a solitary island </p>
            <p>Lamented as following.</p>

<p>What should I do.</p>
<p>Having no place to hide shame and rage,</p>
<p>What should I do</p>
<p>with my anxious mind.</p>

<p>Having clouded up in the sky,</p>

<p>The world's mind is dark,</p>
<p>So I do not know a single day's work.</p>
<p>Oh! solitary time.</p>
<p>A man's mind has no place to go,</p>
<p>Hiding himself in the small island</p>
<p>That the blue waves enclose,</p>
<p>Seeing the sky,</p>
<p>A day comes and just goes.</p>

<p>Let us cry facing the silence to have justice fall asleep.</p>
<p>Let us cry like rain</p>
<p>Let us cry like rivers.</p>
<p>Let us cry looking at the sky</p>
<p>Let us cry looking at the ground.</p>
<p>Seeing the humanity of this land</p>
<p>Like a dark sea</p>
<p>Like a devil's hell,</p>
<p>Let us cry together.</p>

<p>My body is like the lord of the castle</p>
<p>My mind is like a sinner's.</p>
<p>I hung the ambition in my heart</p>
<p>At the main entrance.</p>
<p>At the isolated place in a small island,</p>
<p>Even a friend is not visiting,</p>
<p>An ivy is keeping and watching me.</p>
<p>When I see the shape</p>
<p>Cooking and washing,</p>
<p>Somebody is washing pebbles outdoors.</p>

<p>When day was dawning by the window.</p>
<p>Flowers are blooming</p>
<p>Leaves are sprouting,</p>
<p>So has spring come.</p>

<p>Has spring come just to you.</p>
