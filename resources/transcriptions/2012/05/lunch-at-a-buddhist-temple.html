<div class='post_body'>Tathagata: What you are learning is not real Buddha's teaching. 
<p />
Monk: Why not?
<p />

T: Because you should tell very clearly what is originated by what cause. (I told to your teacher) But nobody amongst you know what is the result. This teaching will make you to waste your time and your life. I'd like to repay you for your kindness today. Be careful practicing meditation. If you practice meditation, people lose themselves and they can invite some ghosts (dead spirits) inside. In this case, you have very unstable sentiments (emotions) and start to speak what they don't know. (they speak very carelessly what they don't know)
<p />

Soyun (interpreter): (they don't know but they speak carelessly)

<p />
T: this is the way to accumulate bad karma. Because the bikkhu (your teacher) didn't give me any questions --

<p />
S: Ah --

<p />
T: He gave us kindness, that's why I didn't give questions to him. Even though I ask him ten thousand questions, they can't answer even one right answer. Instead if he asks to me ten thousand questions then I can answer to him 100% right. In this world we have one principle. Everything exists (everything in this world is) by this principle. When you learn Buddha's teaching properly you can understand (you can see) this principle. Because the monks in this country don't know this principle that's why I understand that you don't learn properly Buddha's teaching. 

<p />
M: What is your principle? I would like to know about the principle.

<p />
T: The principle means something is decided (fixed). For example, in mathematics five plus five makes ten. This is the principle of this mathematics. In this world, according to the problems, good thing, bad thing happen. You haven't learned properly about this. When you learn this thing properly you can obtain good yourself.

<p />
M: How can I learn the principle?
  <p />

T: It's very simple. First, you should meet the enlightened master. Listen to the enlightened master and you should check what is (what you've heard from the master -- you should check in the reality). </div>
