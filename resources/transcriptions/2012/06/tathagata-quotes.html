<h4>During a talk at the hotel while preparing to go out for the day</h4>
<blockquote>Tathagata: Satto, if Soyun shows a little bit strange behavior, then stop working<br />Satto: Stop working &ndash; Okay<br />T: In this world whenever we do something good the evils always make problems. It is difficult for us to overcome their obstacles with our power. Only I can resist (prevent) them from giving damage. This work seems very easy but not any one can do this mission. Yesterday the monk told us that it was a fact &ndash; he told<br />Soyun: him <em>[Tathagata]</em><br />T: that, "You are Buddha in the future (you are messiah)".* &ndash; That's true!<br /><em>* [Note: Tathagata is referring to a monk who, in passing, ridiculed the master with this sentence.]</em><br />*Satto laughs*<br />T: So they will never come near a living Buddha. In spite of their neglect, we try to meet them and we visit them. This is mercy and love.</blockquote></div>
