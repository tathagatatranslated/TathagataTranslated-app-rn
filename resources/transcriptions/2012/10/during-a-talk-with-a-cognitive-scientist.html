<p style="">Tathagata: From now on you can ask me about your questions. Then I'll explain to you how you can see through which way.</p>

<p style="">Professor: What is the goal of our discussion?</p>

<p style="">Tathagata: In order to understand properly about the world of human beings, these things should be informed to people rightly. When people understand how their consciousness system is formed and what is the role of their consciousness, then they don't behave carelessly. Good people build good society. In order to make good people, they need to understand with principle how everything happens in their lives. I'm trying to make people for good. There is one thing very, very difficult for human beings: it is learning. Nobody wants to know the really important thing for them, and everybody tries to teach something for others through only books, but they don't really understand them. When we research something, we need to see something whole. Then we can find exactly the system of what organization do what. But the modern intellectual world tries to find something from every part. They can contribute to develop mechanisms in this way, but they failed already to make people safe, and make the quality of human life better. Recently we have lots of debate about environmental problems on Earth. Yesterday I visited MIT because I wanted to meet somebody in the environmental research center. I requested an interview, but no one wanted to meet me &ndash; they were very alert of me and all had the excuse of being too busy. I absolutely know their research will not be able to contribute to society. We have the phenomenon of global warming (climate change); this phenomenon causes and predicts very serious things to save this present society. The real focus of their research should be the research for gravity. But scientists cannot understand completely yet what is the real role of gravity on this Earth. They don't know how is gravity generated (formed), how gravity keeps itself (preserves itself), and how they have "crack" in the gravity field.</p>
