<h3>Beginning discussion with a primate cognition scientist</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p class="p1">Tathagata: The Society of Natural Science has established in 1984 and we study what will happen in the future through studying the present. What is your subject or what have you learned?</p>
<p class="p1">Professor: Ah, I study primate cognition. So this is what monkeys and other closely related species know about the world: how they think about the physical world and how they think about the social world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">T: This part is very difficult to understand. I'm wondering what principle do you use for your study. How do you perceive the matters?</p>
<p class="p1">P: You mean how do we learn what monkeys know?</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun (Korean-English interpreter): Yeah. What principle do you use for your study (research).</p>
<p class="p1">P: Well, I guess the principle &ndash; so the intuition we have, the reason we do it &ndash; is to look at the evolution of cognition, so the goal is to really see what our human ancestors looked like. Not just what they looked like but what their cognition was like, what their mind was like, back in the ancestral environment. And the way we do it is to study monkeys, to study closely related primates, to try to see what they know about the world. Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean by 'the principle' exactly.</p>
<p class="p1">*Tathagata laughs softly*</p>
<p class="p1">P: Yeah? Yeah</p>
<p class="p1">T: All the animals has their intuition from their instincts. In order to search this matter, we need a very basic fundamental knowledge. This is very important for researchers: What principle do they apply for their study? Otherwise, they just make up a kind of story that is very distant (remote) from reality. Actually I haven't conversed with animals &ndash; I was not so interested in understanding animals. That's why I don't know about the consciousness of animal. If I don't know about this, then I'm convinced that nobody can understand this matter. However I understand more than 95% of things that human beings can understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">P: What makes human different? Why are we special?</p>

<p style="">T: Ah. Persimmon &ndash;</p>

<p style="">S: Do you know persimmon? Fruit</p>

<p style="">P: Ah, yes.</p>

<p style="">T: Even though they have same plant, but they have very different characters of seeds. Here is a fruit, and it keeps everything in it what happened during its life, and it transmits to another seed for next generation. When we plant a seed, it will make the same fruit (same thing) that it could take from the former generation. If it doesn't meet any other special circumstance or environment then the nature of the seed will not change. One principle applies to plants or animals (same living creature). We have difficulties to examine closely this matter in animals. We cannot observe with our naked eyes the process of movement of the 'motae'. Lots of animals finish their life only with activities of their instinct, not of consciousness.</p>

<p style="">S: Before they have consciousness, they only keep their living from their instincts.</p>

<p style="">T: All the creatures are born with what is in their 'motae', and they revive from their 'motae'. Even though they didn't form their consciousness but they can be born with their only instincts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">*Soyun speaks with Tathagata and then laughs briefly*</p>

<p style="">S: I reminded him of your question. You asked why we are so special, everybody is different&hellip;. because:</p>

<p style="">T: We have different thing in our 'motae'.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Motae is korean words, it means the real origin of our life.</p>

<p style="">P: So kind of the&hellip; genes?</p>

<p style="">S: Mm&hellip; this is not genes.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">T: Human beings have different characters, different temperature, and habits because they have different things in their 'motae'. And human beings' 'motae' is formed from what happened in their past lives and what happened is all accumulate in their 'motae'. Suppose there is a person who was always telling untruth</p>

<p style="">S: You know, to tell a lie</p>

<p style="">T: in his past life. When he revives (come to life again), what happened in his past life will form his new 'motae'.</p>

<p style="">P: I see. So it's kind of an idea that&hellip; humans have special 'motae' because they bring with them their past lives into new lives, that's what makes us human.</p>

<p style="">S: Yes. Yeah. Everybody has different things in their 'motae'.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">T: What is human beings' 'motae' has great attachment and they try extremely much to keep themselves. Even though somebody lived several hundred years ago, but he or she always told lies, then when they come back to life even five hundred years later, they do same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">P: So they have a&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yes</p>

<p style="">P: Mm, I understand. That makes sense.</p>

<p style="">T: We observed this matter and we confirmed and there's not something wrong there (it's very accurate). But, it might be quite difficult for you to understand and receive my explanation because this is your first time to contact this knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">P: Yeah...</p>

<p style="">T: We usually need two years of time to understand what is in the basis and fundament of human beings. But it must be very new for you because you didn't have any correct information and knowledge about this part.&nbsp;</p>
