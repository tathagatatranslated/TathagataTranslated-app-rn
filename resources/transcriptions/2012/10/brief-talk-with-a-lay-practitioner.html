<div class='post_body'><p style="">Master Tathagata: The results are the same through meditation or drinking poison. When you practice meditation for a long time, you can finish your life. But when you finish your life, it means you are not exist anymore, then in this case, you don't have any suffering. I experienced nirvana and emancipation. I experienced that all the illusions and agony disappeared (finished) after attaining nirvana, but hunger and cold still exist. As long as you are alive, you are influenced by environment. If they understand the nirvana as the end of all the suffering, it means that they finish their life completely. But Buddha taught that, because He regarded people's life are so precious, living is very important. But here people believe that they can have Enlightenment through practicing meditation.</p>
