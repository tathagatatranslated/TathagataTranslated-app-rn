<p style="">Part 3</p>

<p style="">*Recording starts*</p>

<p style="">Professor of English: I don't have any idea why, he doesn't know why</p>

<p style="">Soyun (Interpreter for Tathagata): Ah, he doesn't know.</p>

<p style="">P: He told me that&ndash;</p>

<p style="">*Soyun translates*</p>

<p style="">*Tathagata laughs loudly, replies*</p>

<p style="">Tathagata: We've been visited philosophy department a few days ago. And we met a professor&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: &hellip; Not a professor&hellip;. or&hellip;</p>

<p style="">Dominick: Teacher. She was a teacher</p>

<p style="">S: Hm?</p>

<p style="">D: She was a teacher.</p>

<p style="">S: Teacher. Yeah, teacher, when we visited the philosophy department. So, he asked her, "What do you teach here?"</p>

<p style="">T: So because she answered, "I teach philosophy." So then, "What do you&ndash;</p>

<p style="">S: Ah&ndash; "Do you know what the truth means" &ndash; "What is the meaning (this _________ [Transcription note: Might be "mission"]) of philosophy?"</p>

<p style="">T: She said she was very busy, she was going to class, so, requested us come Saturday and then there will be more professors here, they can talk us. So we come here today. Do you think we made a mistake with our question?</p>

<p style="">P: &hellip; I really have no way of knowing, I don't know who you spoke to in the philosophy department. All that they told me was that they received a message asking you not to go back upstairs. That's all that they said.</p>

<p style="">Satto: Are you a professor? &ndash; Are you a professor?</p>

<p style="">P: I teach in the English department.</p>

<p style="">Satto: English</p>

<p style="">&hellip;</p>

<p style="">P: You'll have to excuse me, I have&hellip;</p>

<p style="">*P exits*</p>

<p style="">&hellip;</p>

<p style="">*T speaks, laughing*</p>

<p style="">T: We just ask her what is philosophy</p>

<p style="">Satto: Yeah&hellip; we didn't, uh</p>

<p style="">S (amending): What do you mean&hellip; what&ndash; What do you define as philosophy. This is a very good thing to debate, but &ndash;</p>

<p style="">*T says something*</p>

<p style="">S: So,</p>

<p style="">T: You have seen by yourselves &ndash; they use guards and bar us to come to the department.&nbsp;</p>
