<p style="">S: Yes</p>

<p style="">D: Is it far from Seoul?</p>

<p style="">S: Oh&hellip; almost over 500 km?</p>

<p style="">D: Oh!&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Second biggest city</p>

<p style="">D: Second biggest&hellip; It's industrial area, no?</p>

<p style="">S: Mm&hellip; it's poor. Commercial, yeah,&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S, D: Commercial</p>

<p style="">S: Very fortunate...</p>

<p style="">D: Then how come you know our place? Our institution&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Uh, yes&hellip; Somebody introduced your institution&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: Oh good</p>

<p style="">S: Mister Hakim, from _____ [Editor's note: Couldn't hear the name well enough, sounds like the name of a university but didn't find a good match on Wikipedia]</p>

<p style="">T: ________</p>

<p style="">S: Ah, ________&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Oh, thank you, thank you</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Thank you thank you thank you&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: And just, I come here to translate both of you, because Mr. Lee doesn't speak English.</p>

<p style="">D: You&hellip; madame? Your name?</p>

<p style="">S: Soyun.</p>

<p style="">D: So - yun. Soyun. You don't have card or something?</p>

<p style="">S: Uh, yeah, I've one. But I'm on holiday&hellip;</p>

<p style="">&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: And uh&hellip; that guy? Jae Hong. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Jae Hong.</p>

<p style="">S: Mm, secretary.</p>

<p style="">D: Secretary. Oh. And you are from the Society of Natural Science?</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: Oh, Center for Human Education! Okay&hellip;</p>

<p style="">Tathagata: I have many questions about Malaysia.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">S: (He said)</p>

<p style="">T: I've been traveling lots of countries around the world</p>

<p style="">D: So difficult, yeah&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Lots of countries, around the world</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: But I'm still&ndash; Malaysia is very strange</p>

<p style="">D: Very strange</p>

<p style="">S: Strange, yes</p>

<p style="">T: I would like to meet some very sincere people in this country</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: if you have.</p>

<p style="">D: Mhm</p>

<p style="">T: But it's quite difficult to find out the very sincere people in this age.</p>

<p style="">D: Oh&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: I would like to give my knowledge and my view&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">*Something in the room emits a loud beep, after which a cell phone plays an audio notification usually used for a new message arriving*</p>

<p style="">T: but very few people want to get my knowledge and my view.</p>

<p style="">D: Okay&hellip; okay</p>

<p style="">T (Soyun laughing lightly): However</p>

<p style="">T: I'm getting very old.</p>

<p style="">S: Hehe</p>

<p style="">D: hahaha&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: That's why my worry is getting more and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">*What sounds like ceramic teacups arrive*</p>

<p style="">T: There are two things [Soyun (amending): too many things] in this world. One thing is that God can do for people. And the other one is that human being can do something for God.</p>

<p style="">D: Oh&hellip;!</p>

<p style="">S: Interesting thing?</p>

<p style="">*Tathagata speaks the next line*</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah, "god"</p>

<p style="">T: Every god don't know what they can do really for human beings. Another one is that human beings also don't know what they can do for the god [Editor's note: Not sure if this was plural "gods" or singular "god"]. I have one question. Can I&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah, sure</p>

<p style="">T: give you?</p>

<p style="">T: Do you have any information in your Islam in this the end of the world,</p>

<p style="">S: "Age of end of world" or "end of the world"</p>

<p style="">T: if the Messiah</p>

<p style="">D: Messiah</p>

<p style="">S: Messiah</p>

<p style="">T: come to the world to save people?</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">S: Do you have &ndash; that message?</p>

<p style="">D: We&ndash; we have the message.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Even in Islamic tradition, we believe that the Messiah, he will be Imam Mahdi &ndash; the Mahdi, the Messiah &ndash; and also, uh, in our tradition is Isa &ndash; in Christianity, Jesus</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Jesus will come back.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Mm, Jesus will come back</p>

<p style="">D: to save the planet.</p>

<p style="">S: Mm?</p>

<p style="">D: So, the end of the world &ndash; before the end of the world, the doomsday&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Yes, the doomsday</p>

<p style="">D: The messiah will&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Messiah will come.</p>

<p style="">D: Will come down&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Alright</p>

<p style="">D: and save the planet. Save&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Mankind</p>

<p style="">D: Save from the bad things&hellip; you know?</p>

<p style="">S: Mm</p>

<p style="">D: The evil</p>

<p style="">S: Yes</p>

<p style="">D: From the&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Yes</p>

<p style="">D: Destruction</p>

<p style="">S: From evil, and destruction&hellip; *translates*</p>

<p style="">T: About that issue, because God can't do this thing by itself, that's why he sent somebody to this world for human beings. But I couldn't find anyone who <em>really</em> waiting for Messiah.&nbsp; &ndash;</p>

<p style="">D: Um, Soyun, actually&hellip; Muslims, we do believe the Messiah</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: As a matter of fact</p>

<p style="">S: Mm?</p>

<p style="">D: Uh&hellip;. But, on the other hand, what is important for the human beings, we the people, we must do good. As Muslim we must do good&hellip; to people, to the human kind. To save the planet, you know? Reject the bad things, reject the evil&hellip; you know? Re-reject the&hellip; extremism. Reject all the bad, bad things in life. That should be our way. But unfortunate, as you see, all over, war, you know? Injustice ______ people, and&hellip; a lot of destruction, you know? And this, you know, actually, damns my people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah&hellip; *translates*</p>

<p style="">S: But I need, uh&hellip; one of his sentences, to translate it, the last one. He said that, "Messiah (when Messiah comes to this world), his appearance is like just a normal human being."</p>

<p style="">D: Mm&hellip;.</p>

<p style="">T: That's why nobody could save these human beings (this mankind) from the danger. I've met <em>many</em> of scientists so far, but I knew the knowledge of all the scientists I met was very, very little.</p>

<p style="">S: (Their knowledge are very, very you know, very little part)</p>

<p style="">D: Very shallow</p>

<p style="">S: Mm, very shallow</p>

<p style="">T: This world, at the moment, is in really danger, but people even don't imagine about how the danger is so (Soyun: Uh) crisis. In order to become the friend (friendship) between us, we will need lots of trials (to be my friend). Because the knowledge of (the limitation of knowledge of mine) is very much higher than even God's. Nobody can understand my knowledge without the process of confirmation. I have been trying to solve these matters for long, long years. I have ended up to find one fact&ndash; that this world is run by one principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">*Director speaks briefly in another language to someone*</p>

<p style="">T:&nbsp; I don't care of religion&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Mm</p>

<p style="">S (amending): What kind of religion</p>

<p style="">T: or the races. (My concern is beyond religion and race)</p>

<p style="">D: ____________</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Great [Editor's note: This could have been "right"]</p>

<p style="">T: My only hope is that if I can meet truthful and sincere people, I'd like to give my own knowledge to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Mm&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: I can find any place to work, if I want to do visually (I can find lots of places to work). For example, the Oxford University in UK, they recommended me to come and work with them for 10 years, but I rejected. If I want, I can go there even tomorrow, and I can get my office and gather excellent scientists from around the world and work there. But, I only want to give my knowledge to only truthful people when I meet them. If you have very extraordinary people around you (very intelligent people) then there's a chance I would like to be verified (my knowledge) by them. I can understand (I can perceive) how the end of the world comes, and how can the savior ____ [Editor's note: Could be "then"]&hellip; and how this world will start again, and I have very correct understanding about that. Of course there are lots of people who don't want a person like me appear to this world. That's why I do not want much for human beings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Mm&hellip; So actually, uh&hellip; I get the message.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Uh&hellip; To be frank with you, we are academic institution, we are university level&hellip; so, we teach students here, we have programs, and normally in the daytime, you know, my people is busy, they are teaching their class, you know? So&hellip; at least for now, I can't arrange any meetings with my colleagues because they are in the classroom here teaching. But, actually, the purpose of your president, is he looking for the job or what?</p>

<p style="">S: Uh&hellip; heh. *Translates*</p>

<p style="">T (listening to Soyun): Mm&hellip; mm&hellip; mm&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: I don't come here to find my job.</p>

<p style="">D: Oh&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: I just want to be helpful to people who want to lead the truthful way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Ah, okay&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">*D says something at low volume*&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah, thank you</p>

<p style="">*What sounds like a teacup is placed*</p>

<p style="">T: In case you want to ____ the knowledge of (wisdom of) philosophy,&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Mmm, mhm</p>

<p style="">T: the people under me can _______</p>

<p style="">D: Ohhhh</p>

<p style="">T: They are the best</p>

<p style="">D: alright</p>

<p style="">T: in the world &ndash; it's no problem for them.</p>

<p style="">D: Well&hellip; The society is based in Korea, yeah?</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah. Based in Korea, and London&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: Do you also have&hellip; in Malaysia?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Malaysia is _______, yeah. We bought apartment/office&hellip; heh</p>

<p style="">D: Ohh&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Here at the mall, maybe&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: The mall, yes</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Oh you have the&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: At the end of the mall, there's a&ndash;</p>

<p style="">D: You are doing charity work, or what?</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah, charity.</p>

<p style="">D: Charity. Oh&hellip; what is your target group? The target group</p>

<p style="">S: Ah&hellip; the group?</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah. That you work with&hellip; in Malaysia.</p>

<p style="">S: In Malaysia? Oh&hellip; just he said that he is looking for some good people</p>

<p style="">D: Oh, good people</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah, sincere, and&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Good</p>

<p style="">S: who really want to learn their life in right way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Okay&hellip;.</p>

<p style="">&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: If your god wants for me to give the knowledge to help you, then I also give away a blessing for the god. Because this world is run by one principle. So if somebody can understand what is in this principle then they can achieve everything what they want to. So, we need to know very exactly about this fact. This world is run under by the gods (world of gods).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: That's why the last thing I want is that to conflict with the gods. If you want</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: to know about your future, or the future of people you love,&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: or about the world, then, I can tell you immediately only on the condition that you have the permission of your god. When you have permission from your god, then I can tell you immediately about all you want to know. And I'm ready to take responsibility when my answers are wrong.</p>

<p style="">D: Oh, okay&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: And the truth is not changed for me, so it always exists.</p>

<p style="">D: Uh&hellip; are you promoting any specific religion, or&hellip;?</p>

<p style="">T: I don't need to get any religion. Because I don't know everything about the world of religion, _____, after my death, nobody</p>

<p style="">S: &hellip; ah&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">T: people shouldn't do to use my name under the name of religion.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: So now, Soyun, actually, you have the office in Malaysia here already?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">T: Actually, we have house (condominium), __________, but we cannot say we start as an office now because the people are not enough _____ office. If we can be friends</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: Then I can share all the knowledge about economics, and politics,</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: &hellip; all the fields in the world. The question has the answers, in mathematics. If we can confirm what is in the questions, then we can understand the answer of the question is necessary for me or not (I want the answer or not).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Okay&hellip; So, all this I understand&hellip; so&hellip; actually, he's looking friend.</p>

<p style="">S: Hmm&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: He's looking friend?</p>

<p style="">S: Uh&hellip; *asks in Korean*</p>

<p style="">D: To share&ndash; and he would like to share knowledge with them</p>

<p style="">T (via Soyun): Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah&hellip; So, I'm ready to work with anybody&hellip; because, as a student, also, I have traveled a lot&hellip; I've never been to Korea, but I've been to Japan before. I've been to ________, to United States, and I've traveled a lot and I met a lot of people. I met a lot of good people</p>

<p style="">S: Mm</p>

<p style="">D: you know, and they are always with me&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Mm&hellip;</p>

<p style="">D: So&hellip; on that ground, actually, uh&hellip; we, generally speaking, we people in Malaysia, we are a God-believer people, which means that, you know, uh, majority of people are Muslim, or Islam. But other religions, like uh&hellip; Christian&hellip;,</p>

<p style="">*Phone begins to ring*</p>

<p style="">D: Hindu, Buddha, &hellip; or Buddhism</p>

<p style="">S: Buddhism</p>

<p style="">D: Buddhism&hellip; uh, and other religions we practice in Malaysia also,&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah, so, we believe in God. We believe in God. *Soyun translates* Whatever we do we are under the control of the God. And, as a Muslim, uh&hellip; we believe in Allah. Allah is God. Okay, it's stated in our&hellip; we have our holy book, Al-Quran, the holy scripture, and that is the final revelation, and that is the main source of reference for every Muslim. So, whatever you say just now, yeah, we can share. As Muslim, we have certain principle, you know, certain principle</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: We do believe in God, and uh&hellip; God, will determine &ndash; will decide &ndash; the next course of action for every one of us. That is our belief.</p>

<p style="">T: Because that's not perfectly accurate, that's why I come to this world&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Mhm</p>

<p style="">T: to add something missing there. Today, I came here by taxi, and I walked up to the third floor. I just come here freely, and will go back freely, without any grand assistance around me. *Soyun begins to laugh* I just come here by taxi in simple way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: From where you get financial assistance?</p>

<p style="">T: I say I work to save this world. Then, in this situation, if I can't solve even my daily life, how can I save this world? I can be prominent very soon wherever I work. I spend three years for my own life and I make money for three years, and I spent those money until now to travel the world. And when people have a good feeling to me, then they are rewarded from their ________ [Editor's note: This could be "sincerity" but not sure]. My members who close to me live very well.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: I hope I can be rich like him.</p>

<p style="">T: It's very simple. If you understand the principle of this world and use them (use the principle), it's very easy to achieve your wish. So it's very helpful to you to _____ [Could be "see" or "perceive", unsure] about my knowledge. It's impossible to discuss with me more than 10 minutes even though they are the specialist of the fields. No scientist could get my questions more than three minutes so far in the world. So I can see all the problems that they have during I listen to them. In this world, all of the things are connected like the questions in mathematics. If you see the things in the world in complete way (educated way), then it is very complicated. But, if you see the things in the world in simple way, then the world is very simple. If we have ________ [maybe "fate"] and become friends, I can present one gift to you. I can give you the ability to get your future by yourself. If you can have such ability (knowledge) then you can be the first man in any field. You have a good book, the Quran. In case you gather all the experts and very higher scholars of Quran and have discuss with me about the contents of the Quran, then I do not guarantee they will answer my question. There are numerous universities in this world and they get very _______ students. I've asked some people who have the Ph. D. degree from __________ university. Our common understanding about university is that university is the place to pursue the truth. When I met people who had Ph. degree from Oxford or _______ university, I gave this question, "What is truth?" I met no one who could answer the definition of truth. It means that they don't know anything about truth, they've never learned of truth. People are easily deceived by the degrees that they have because they don't know how they can conform their knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S (quietly): It's just you know&hellip; they are cheated by the ________ ["normal"?] degree</p>

<p style="">D: By the way, how long have you been here in Malaysia?</p>

<p style="">S: How?</p>

<p style="">D: How long&hellip; have you been here in Malaysia? For how long?</p>

<p style="">S: Mister Lee is staying here for ten days.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: And you?</p>

<p style="">S: Me? About</p>

<p style="">T: Two months</p>

<p style="">D: Oh&hellip;. But you're working in Korea.</p>

<p style="">S [Not sure if she is translating Tathagata, she may in fact be as Tathagata is speaking in reply]: Yes. We're based in Korea, but I travel a lot. In autumn, I'm going to Beijing to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: To work in Beijing&hellip;. For how long&ndash; in Beijing?</p>

<p style="">S: Beijing&hellip; two months?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Two months?</p>

<p style="">S: About two months. And after that, going to Moscow.</p>

<p style="">D: Moscow? Ah&hellip; Maybe I can visit your place in Korea?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Hehe&hellip; welcome!&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">T: Our office is a small place and all the people have their own selves, so if they don't need _________ then they don't like.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: Have you heard about the phoenix?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D, S: Phoenix&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">S: The&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S, D: Bird</p>

<p style="">S: ______ ["that lives"?] in heaven</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: If the phoenix appear in Earth, then how it will be treated? When the sparrow or the&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: &hellip;</p>

<p style="">Jae Hong: Pigeon</p>

<p style="">S: Pigeon!</p>

<p style="">T: meets the phoenix, then they cannot match &ndash; they don't like him. That's why the phoenix have to live alone until it died. I was born as a human being, but I didn't even have the affection of my mother. This is the case (example) that when a greater person comes to this world, they cannot match with the __________ ["comrades"?]. Don't think that our fate today (meeting) _________ so easily&hellip; (This is a very particular _______). I came to this world, I had two suggestions. One was that I receive the help of gods. If I accepted the help of god, then I'd be one of the richest person in this world &ndash; to get my own airplane&hellip;</p>

<p style="">S: Hehehe</p>

<p style="">T: But I rejected the suggestion, I choose the way of human being. This was even hard for me to climb to the third floor, but I never regret the rejection of the suggestion. I will remain a very beautiful story through my life. You will need quite lots time to understand me&hellip;. But the value of your time to try to understand me is very _______</p>

<p style="">D: Thank you. Thank you&hellip;</p>

<p style="">T: If you have some of remarkable people around you</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah&hellip; yeah</p>

<p style="">T: Could you arrange a meeting before I leave for Korea?</p>

<p style="">D: Yeah, we try.</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">T: I leave for Korea 26th</p>

<p style="">D: 26th</p>

<p style="">T: Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">D: We try&hellip; we try to find time to get people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: We try our best and then we get back to you. Ah&hellip; I thank you also because it's a very enlightening talk, you know?</p>

<p style="">S: Yeah</p>

<p style="">D: A lot of wisdom&hellip; And I really learned from him, and we hope you can really build our good relationship forever.</p>
