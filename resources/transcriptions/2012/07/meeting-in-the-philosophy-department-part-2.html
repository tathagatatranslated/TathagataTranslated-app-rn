I asked her, "How did you learn the philosophy, and how do you teach the philosophy?"<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S (amending): What did you learn of what is philosophy<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: But she changed much about this question.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Mm&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: She said, "I have to go to class."<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Mm.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: "I don't have time."<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Mm&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: And she recommended us come again<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Here?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: Yes. Today<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sato: There.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: or yesterday.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Oh, to&hellip;?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sato: The department<br /> S: Philosophy department&ndash; then there will be some more professors&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Mm, mm&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: So that's why this morning we visited the department again.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: mm<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: But, the guards&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: The security guards<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: The security guards there<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: they didn't speak english, they didn't explain properly, but they just barred us, "Don't come into the building."<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: &ndash; Oh! Okay&hellip; The problem is that um, um, that um, we have security guards at the building and then those, who would&ndash; those, the&hellip; the people who do not work in the building will have to get permission to&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: Yeah, but, uh&hellip;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: &hellip; to enter the building. So what you could do is&ndash;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: May I talk?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: &ndash; You have to uh, call, the, uh&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: Yeah, but, uh, he &ndash; one&hellip; English/Thai person translated what the guards say to us, and the guards say, "We were not allowed," the department of philosophy told them&ndash;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> D: They specifically instructed&ndash;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: "Don't allow these persons to enter in the department."<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Okay&hellip; so&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *S begins to translate for T*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P:&nbsp; then&hellip; what could we do for you now? &ndash; What would you&hellip; what would you like us to do?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: He will&hellip; answer you.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *S translates for T*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: We are very interested in the education in this university. If we write a book from all our recording here, then I'm afraid that you will be disgraced. I don't find that there was something fault in my question. In order to converse about philosophy, the first step is that we need to define clearly what philosophy is. This is first step, and next, we can debate more. And she has Ph. D.,<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S (amending): For example, she, only we met one person here, so, she has Ph. D.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: of philosophy, but if she teach philosophy without right understanding what philosophy is then this is little bit ridiculous.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Oh&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: So,<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: In order to understand this problem we are going to the president room now, and we will write in public through internet and books.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P: Okay&hellip;. I need to talk to this specific professor and find out what happens. There might be some misunderstanding in the communication or something, just let me&hellip; get her on the phone and see what can be done.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: Mm *translates and speaks with T for a moment*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T (via Soyun): Have you recorded everything that time?&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: We have enough?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: Yes. Because I can record so many hours and many times I don't stop it. Then __________. Even in the taxi, sometimes<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: Hehe...<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *Beeping in the background, maybe a phone*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *S converses with T*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> T: In order to protect people, we need to report this fact to the world<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S (amending): To protect people not to have damage from the wrong teaching<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> D: _______ hello Satto!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: It's okay.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *Satto laughs quietly*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> D: _______ take a picture!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P (coming back): So um, if you could just wait for a while, because we need to contact those people involved and see what happens. So that&hellip; I'm&ndash; I'm pretty sure that there may be some misunderstanding. So I just, you know, have my staff check with people and see what happens.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S [Maybe interpreting something T said previously, not sure]: Because we have recording here&hellip; so if they speak something wrong then I will show&ndash; I will let you listen<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P (As S is speaking): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. I understand how you feel in this situation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &hellip;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: But&hellip; but I don't have it with me, now.&hellip; It's another tape on the hotel.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> S: Oh&hellip; that's why master checked, "We should tell her, we will bring the tape"<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: I thought you said 'What we record now'<br /> &nbsp;<br /> D: Satto&hellip; Well&hellip; do you want&hellip; Soyun?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Satto: I think it's better we can go now<br /> &nbsp;<br /> D: Soyun&hellip;? Would it be better for Satto to tell her now?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *S talks to T, T says something but it doesn't get translated*<br /> &nbsp;<br /> *recording ends*</p>
