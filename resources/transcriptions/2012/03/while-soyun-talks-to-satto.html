<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Satto</strong>: So Tathagata decided to be born in so hard conditions, in this life?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun</strong>: Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto</strong>: He decided himself to be born in so hard conditions?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun</strong>: Mm&hellip; yes. It is all planned. Everything carried under the plans. So he made his own destiny like this, and he trained himself in the hardest circumstance to do this work. That's why he can adjust to <em>any</em> serious circumstance.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto</strong>: You mean if he was born in a more comfortable life, he wouldn't&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun</strong>: No, it is almost impossible for anyone to do this. He agrees &ndash; if he didn't have such trial, such hardest training, then he couldn't stand this hard circumstance. &hellip; These days, our travel is very posh. Especially this time. But last times I always lost 3 or 4 kilograms. And one reason is that Master is very weak. He can't be so active. If he has endless energy, then he never has to stop and lie down. So, extremely hard.&nbsp;</p></div>
