<h3>Satto asks Master Tathagata about dreams</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> I want to ask about dreams - if I'm having very strange dreams. They have any meaning, sometimes, dreams? I can explain one I had. I wake up almost, with that one.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> These days?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun: </strong>Oh, here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Mhm. But tonight, more.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Dominic:</strong> Last night ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> They are not nightmares, but one dream&hellip; but, you tell first then I'll explain.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> Oh, hehe..</p>

<p style=""><strong>Dominic:</strong> Do dreams having meaning ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun interprets into Korean for Master Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> Dream is meaningless. So, when you dream something that it seems you can't overcome (it means it's quite dreadful), then I'll make a connection with your consciousness when you sleep. Because you are doing too holy thing these days, so the ghosts around you are frightened and they're unstable. Don't believe in others' words. You should judge everything by yourself.&nbsp;</p>
