<h3>Meeting a brain & cognitive science specialist</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p>Tathagata: I believe that I can give you satisfied answers and explanation about the function of the organs in body and structures of body. In this world we have only one principle. When we see the matters, even though that's big or small, on this principle, we can find all the answers from that. It's like a mathematician &ndash; when a mathematician knows how to solve a problem, the size of the number does not matter for him. Maybe if you found that it was very difficult to understand the matter, then maybe I can see very easily. Or, you thought, 'oh it's very easy to find the fact', but when you listen to me, it could be changed to a very difficult matter. The most important thing of our conversation is that how we can verify the truth of our conversation &ndash; truth is most important. So we need to talk on the matter (on some matter). <em>*Tathagata laughs*&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Professor: So&hellip; the area that I work in is how the brain supports (in people) thoughts and feelings&hellip; thoughts and feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>T: Let me point one sample. Where does light (electric) come from?</p>
<p>P: The bulb. Partly comes from the bulb.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>*Tathagata laughs*</em></p>
<p>T: It needs to be connected to source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P: Oh, mhm.</p>
<p>T: Brain itself doesn't remember anything.</p>
<p>P: Mhm&hellip;</p>
<p>T: Lots of people mention about mind, and mind is like light. When consciousness arise, mind arise. When consciousness come into dormancy, then mind doesn't open (operate).</p>
<p>P: And may I ask, do we know this from thinking, or from research or from research, or is it a&hellip; philosophy&hellip; or science?</p>
<p>Soyun (translator for T): So, pardon, again?</p>
<p>P: This idea comes from&nbsp;philosophy or science?</p>
<p>T: Philosophy and science are not separate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P: Oh, yeah, mhm.</p>
<p>T: If somebody wants to be a real scientist, they should know philosophy first.</p>
<p>P: Mhm</p>
<p>T: If you know philosophy, really, then you naturally come to know science. So when you study science, the foundation of that you can find philosophy there. So philosophy and science is two sides of one coin.</p>
<p>P: Okay</p>
<p>S: Yeah</p>
<p>T: You understand a little some of the part if you can concentrate on giving me continuous questions &ndash; then you will come to know a little of one part, and I can guide you so that you can understand by my explanation through many of cases (examples).</p>
<p>P: Mhm. Um&hellip; so, it was interesting about the mind not being in the brain, because for most of our research if a person has a brain injury, in one part of the brain or another, they lose consciousness of one thing or another. So if they have an injury in the back of the brain they lose consciousness of what they see &ndash; they cannot see anything with their eyes.</p>
<p>S: Alright</p>
<p>T: Okay. Very, very good question. It's the same when you have problem in the electricity source in a car, you cannot start the engine. That's the same _____ [@33:44, could be "reason].</p>
<p>P: Same&ndash; yeah, okay.</p>
<p>S: Yes</p>
<p>T: When you give me continuous questions then I can tell you the cases.</p></div>
