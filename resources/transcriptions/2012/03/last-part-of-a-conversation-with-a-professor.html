<h3>During the last part of a conversation with a professor of linguistics</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Linguistics professor:</strong> You start out by saying the brain is an organ, but actually the organs are actually &ndash; you think of them as systems. For example, the circulatory system is a sequence of organs connected in a certain way. And if you think of the visual system, it's a piece of the brain, it's the neural run between the eyes and the brain, and the holes. There's these sort of&ndash; you use the word organ like a kidney but really the kidney is a piece of a system that deals with various aspects of life, and the brain has pieces, you know, that connect to this and connect to that, and connect all around, you know?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> The battery is the same. We can say the battery has the same structures</p>

<p style=""><strong>L:</strong> No, the battery has very simple structures.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When you know really about the brain, then brain is also work in very simple way. (Not so complicated)</p>

<p style=""><strong>L:</strong> What we know about the brain is that it's a function of evolution, so there are different pieces to it that you find in some animals and you don't find in other animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> This is very, very important for you (for your life itself) to understand this matter. When you understand this matter, your view can elevate very, very higher. If you have any friends in a very big hospital, then we can test directly. For example, here is a patient, and the medical doctor predict he will die today at 2 o'clock. In case if they allow me, I'll give power to the patient's brain, and if the brain doesn't stop to work, he will not die. The life activities will stop when the battery (the electricity) stopped.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>L:</strong> That's true&hellip; mmkay. Yeah. Okay. Hehe.. Good!</p>
