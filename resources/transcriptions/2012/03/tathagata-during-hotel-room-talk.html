<h3>Tathagata during hotel room talk</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>That woman told us she wanted to end her suffering. But, as long as you don't remove ignorance, suffering will exist forever. I experienced nirvana and liberation. When somebody attains the state of nirvana, they can be free from illusion and agony. But, if they don't eat, they feel hungry. If it is warm, he also feels hot. When temperature cold, he also feels cold. So, if things are just like what they expect, it's only death. Buddha taught people not to die forever, but to live forever. They sell Buddha's teaching by their words, but there's no Buddha's teaching in them (Buddha's teaching didn't hand down).</p></div>
