                <p class="p1">*A monk (M) asks Master Tathagata why Master has to check if someone knows Buddha's teaching before He donates 20 million baht to them.*</p>
<p class="p1">Tathagata: Only a person who knows Buddha's teaching can use money for this world. If I donate money to anyone, then it means that I make them a bigger robber. So, it's a crime to donate money to anyone. When you donate something, you should know who receives it. Buddha told, "Cause makes result (effect)."</p>
<p class="p1">M: Right</p>
<p class="p1">T: So, could you give us a good idea where, how, we can meet such a person in Thailand?</p>
<p class="p1">M: Did you ask this question to the highest priest in this university yet? Because here is the&hellip;</p>
<p class="p1">T: Yes, we've asked. But the higher monks (priests) are worse than you.</p>
<p class="p1">*Satto laughs*</p>
<p class="p1">T: They even don't have any intention to know Buddha's teaching rightly. And I also report this to journalists in BMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun (retranslating): I visited Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and there a journalists room - I told them</p>
<p class="p1">M: From which country you are from?</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun: We came from England, but -- Spanish, Korean.</p>
<p class="p1">M: &hellip;</p>
<p class="p1">Satto: Born in Spain</p>
<p class="p1">M: Oh</p>
<p class="p1">Satto: Born in Korea</p>
<p class="p1">M: Oh, Korea.</p>
<p class="p1">T: If we can't contact Buddha's teaching in the country of Buddhism, where we can find Buddha's teaching?</p>
<p class="p1">M: &hellip; The purpose of wanting to know the Buddha teaching is to testify the person only or what else that you have any purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">T: &hellip;</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun: Mm</p>
<p class="p1">T: If you study Buddhism like this or if you learn this way,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">M: This way &ndash; what do you mean this way?</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun: Like this&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">T: then even though you learn 10,000 years, you don't know what Buddha's teaching is. Buddha's teaching has the way in the questions. But you learn something without certain questions. So even though you contact Buddha's teaching, you don't realize (you don't understand) what the problem is. So you see, if anyone can understand Buddha's teaching, why I come to Thailand from England and bet 20 million Baht?</p>
<p class="p1">M: We do not care about the 20 million Baht at all. We only care how to you make you understand what the Buddha teaching is. That is the purpose. We don't care about your 20 million baht. Even 20 million dollar, we don't care.</p>
<p class="p1">*Soyun and a few others laugh*</p>
<p class="p1">T: We can understand immediately if you can teach us with a problem (with a question).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Soyun: Like mathematics, you know?</p>
<p class="p1">M: Because Buddha's teaching is mainly to "do". You have to practice to do thing.</p>
<p class="p1">S: Practice to do thing?</p>
<p class="p1">M: You have to practice.</p>
<p class="p1">S: Oh.</p>
<p class="p1">T [sounding incredulous]: Practice what?</p>
<p class="p1">M: Practice the mindfulness.</p>
<p class="p1">S: Mindfulness?</p>
<p class="p1">M: Yeah, everything you do, you must have your own conscious what you are doing.</p>
<p class="p1">S: Concentrate? Conscious or &hellip;?</p>
<p class="p1">M: That's meditation.</p>
<p class="p1">S: Conscious of what you do?</p>
<p class="p1">M: Yes. You must know what you are doing at every moment.</p>
<p class="p1">T: Mm&hellip; you seem very, very difficult to understand Buddha's teaching. If somebody can know something without learning from others, then they have only one way is that from their experience they can know something. So, how can you do something good if you don't know the world? So, just "do good, you should live good, in right way" &ndash; this is devil says. Buddha never say to people, "Live good." Buddha only teach the way how can you live good. So, when you don't know the way, it's impossible for you to live good.</p>
