~ 40:00 Sixteen Precepts

S: Buddha gave precepts. Master also gave sixteen precepts.

Satto: Sixteen precepts?

S: Yeah. Sixteen precepts. And it was very, very impressive that he explained about the precepts… the preaching was very impressive. The basic aim of the precepts is to prevent us from getting grudge. For example, the first precept's don't kill. Don't kill means don't kill people (person) with the personal desire – because of personal desire, personal emotion. Nobody wants to die and life is most precious for everybody. So, when somebody kill, deprive their life, then they have the worst grudge. To kill others – when somebody kills others, then the soul knows who killed him. 

Satto: The soul knows?

S: Even though he died, he knows who killed him, if somebody kills others, you know…. Then, it make him to have the worst grudge (deepest grudge) to the killer. Then he never forgives the killer because he deprived his life. 

Satto: Wow…

S: Then

Satto: So that's bad because it affects both. 

S: Yes

Satto: That's… the killer, and the killed.

S: Mm… and that person has the worst grudge and their grudge bound somebody who killed them. Then, somebody who kills others are bound by that person's grudge. Before that person unbound, they can't be free from the other's grudge. it means that they lost the freedom of their soul forever, so the chain of grudge is most strongest one in this world. Iron chain is very weak compared to that. That's why always the first of the precepts is don't kill, because if they don't forgive them, they are forever bound by others' grudge. 

Satto: How they forgive?

S: It means that  if I have grudge to you, so I bound you,

Satto: Mhm…

S: then it's easier for me, if I forgive you, then I – it depends on my mind. But when you are bounded by others, before they forgive you, you can't be free. 

Satto: But, after another life, if somebody kills me, for example, I have grudge, how I change – how I forgive? Because I'm having better life or because I'm…?

S: But that is changed into energy so it's their karma. And they repeat again and again: what happened, happens again. So that's why this is very bad suffering – to kill, and killed. 

Satto: But it's possible your destiny is always – yeah, you make your own destiny with your actions, but somebody can kill you anytime, it can happen.

*later*


Satto; So, once you know this law, the precepts are very important….

S: Very important. So, precepts is not something to bound our freedom, but this is a very enjoyable doctrine that we keep through our living. 

Satto: It's like driving– you have to drive that way…. 

S: The precepts is just warning of the traps in life. You shouldn't be trapped by humans. They are all from ignorance because we don't know this way of life then they harm themselves. They trap themselves to death. Master said it's extremely difficult for the blind people to keep the precepts because their karma always order them to do that, automatically order, and they act automatically, like a watch. *laughs*

Satto: Yeah, it's like automatically….

S: Yeah. Before Enlightenment, they can't control their karma. That's why we say that this is fighting 

Satto:  You say without Enlightenment, you mean without a big Enlightenment?

S: Even a little Enlightenment. But it's still very, very difficult for ordinary people to realize their faults - to know themselves. When we know ourselves, we can control ourselves. So, we think how much difficulty to know to see ourselves correctly. That's why a teacher is always very important –

Satto: So…

S: as he sees everything about us. 

Satto: But when he says… he always says that you have to first see the things in the world – things in the world….

S: So, when he travels, he sees things, and he explains what he saw. Then, students can understand. Even though they didn't see that by themselves, they understand from teaching, then they start to see. Because they are taught, they start to see, "Ah, that's why Master said like this." But before he teach, it's difficult to see – the students can't see by themselves. 

Satto: Yeah, of course, like myself… *laughs*

*moments later*

S: When I met the Master the second time, he told like about the changing period, and that he came here as the Messiah, and he is Maitreya Buddha – when he told me about the changing period, then I asked him, "Then all the living things then will die?" So he said, "Yes." Then, "I don't want to die! How can I survive?" And, very simply, you know, he said, "Yes, everything will die." "No, I don't want to die. I want to survive! How?" 

*Satto laughs*

S: Then he said that, "If you want to save yourself, you should save this world." *laughs* His answer was so simple… and I decided, there's no choice, you know? there's no alternative.

Satto (laughing): Yes…

S: It's like… a fish without water, the fish can't stay alive. So, without the world, people can't survive. So to save the world is first. They have connection, you know? Like egg and chicken. Egg first, or chicken first…. *laughs* Then…

Satto: Yeah, you cannot run away from the world.

S: Yeah… then there's no way to save this world first. Without this Earth, who can survive? So I decided. I remember, I don't forget my promise. Then I saved this world. I didn't know how to save this world, but I knew, "I have to save this world !… in order to survive, anything"… and I didn't want to break my words no matter how heavy obstacles always prevent us. I promised to Buddha so… we can't break this word or deny, so that's a promise.
