<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata):</strong> "It's nice to see you." he says.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Water?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Project manager at international Buddhist university:</strong> Oh, yeah, water, please.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Master Tathagata:</strong> You may have received different feeling even though we talk the same thing with the others. It occurs because of the difference of angles (difference of viewpoint). I've never told the lie in my brochure</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Pamphlet</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>that you've read. I came to this world for the world but I haven't done anything yet because people avoid me. So I'm very sorry of my wisdom.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Very sorry?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, "because I don't have opportunity to use my wisdom." he means.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, no, that's always sad&hellip;. People have insights and nobody listens.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I came to the world from the higher level than the Shakyamuni Buddha and Jesus.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (softly):</strong> Do you understand?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, no I understand&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's why I have more difficulties to adjust the cycle with human beings. <strong>*Soyun laughs* </strong>So, of your opinion, what would you do (please tell me your opinion)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh&hellip; of this problem?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Of this problem</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>After 14 years, all the civilization and all the creatures will disappear in this world. In order to prevent this destruction, only I eager to prevent this disaster. Nobody help me (nobody have will). No donors for this work and no countries to exempt any taxes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata begins to laugh quietly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I have to prepare all the expenses for this work and I travel by myself. In spite of this effort, the barrier between me and human beings becomes higher. Now, I've become to regret why I volunteered for this mission. But, even though another god come to this world they should have experienced more difficulties than me for this mission. This human world have already conquered by falsehood.&nbsp; That's why if somebody reveal the truth, they are in danger and risk their life. I have one question for you. I heard you work in the field of Buddhism. Do you have any special reason to choose this job?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> You maybe can select many other jobs with your abilities, then do you have any special reason for this job?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, I think the job chose me. I mean, I came to Thailand without knowing anyone, and I just put myself out into the situation and this is what came out. So, I don't look at it so much as me choosing so much anymore, I look that the universe does sort of provide opportunities, and so, I was working one week a month for over a year, and I did what they needed me to do. And now they need me to do something higher, more complex, so I said, "Yeah, I can do that. It's my skills and I would be happy to do it." But I didn't go searching after it &ndash; campaigning &ndash; to get the job. My intention was to help the university &ndash; to help the university function as best&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>You mean the ________ [redacted] University.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The ________ University.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So when you come to Thailand you had intention already.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No, I had intention to learn more about Buddhism, try to apply Buddhism to world problems. I mean that was my very general intention. I really feel that Buddhism could be very useful to solving world problems.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>People can be deceived by themselves when they don't understand correctly about something. If Buddhism receives Buddha's teaching and teaches what Buddha taught, then it's absolutely helpful for people's life. But in the modern Buddhism, I couldn't find any one anywhere to accept the Buddha's teaching and give Buddha's teaching for people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well the teaching is so basic &ndash; it's such a basic teaching, and so universal &ndash; that people overlook basic and universal, they want smaller things, they look at closer things&hellip; they don't&hellip; it's very hard for most people to look at the very basic pure teachings of a spiritual leader. I&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Yes. It's very hard for people to receive good teachings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Mm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Because of the difference of the point of view (the angles), it's very hard for anyone to see the truth.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well the&hellip; I just wanted to mention something in the&hellip; his&ndash; your brochure. The question &ndash; the most basic question you can ask yourself is, Who am I? and that&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> It's in the brochure&hellip; One of the teachers I respect very highly, Stephen Bachelor, a Buddhist teacher from England, he left Tibetan Buddhism, went to Korea, and studied for 3 years there in a temple, and they gave him one question to deal with, "Who are you? Who am I?" And he asked that for 3 years.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So, you know I think that's the most basic question, and people don't ask that of themselves, and they don't understand, so when they come to a basic teaching, how can you understand a basic teaching if you don't understand who you are?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>In mathematics, when we see figure 1 (number 1), we just understand that is 1. When I ask to myself, who am I? then I is myself. Soyun,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>I am Soyun.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Soyun was deceived for a long time by a high monk (higher monk)&hellip; In Korea, he was very famous monk (very, very famous, very high position monk),&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting Tathagata):</strong> So I went him to learn something. So his first question to me was that Where is your mind?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Where is&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Your mind</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>"Where is your mind?"</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Where is your mind.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> The mind,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S, Satto:</strong> "Where is your mind?"</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So I was very embarrassed (Soyun was very embarrassed at his question). So, after many years later, I met (Soyun met) Master Tathagata and Soyun asked him the same question, "Where is your mind?". So,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I pointed out the light and&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So Master Tathagata light off and asked to Soyun, "Where is the light? (Where is the electric light?)"</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When you switch on, there's light. When you switch off, there's no light. And Master explained to Soyun, "Mind is the same." The light is generated from the electric generator and the mind is generated by what is in consciousness. And Master Tathagata told Soyun, go to the monk again and tell him, "I found my mind."&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>And he guided &ndash; Master guided me if the monks asks me, "Then, where is your mind?" "Soyun, go to him and pinch very strong his leg"</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> What an experience&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>And he was (the monk) was very frightened and *Soyun laughs* asks Soyun, "What are doing??" And Soyun told him, "Oh, I showed my mind to you."</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> It's a very basic teaching in Buddhism&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata begins to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Mind expressed from our behavior. Because mind is expressed through our behavior, we can see others' mind from their behavior. This is very easy question, "Where is your mind?", but the people in general never can answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There's a very famous koan in Japanese Zen Buddhism, "What was your face before you were born?" You know, what is behind your conditioning before you born?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Before you were born. This is one riddle, kong'an, we say kong'an&hellip; What is your real face, what is your real thing&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Real face</p>

<p style=""><strong>S, P:</strong> Real face&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>before you were born&hellip;.<strong> *translates for Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's very easy question. Everything reborn (revives) from what is in 'Motae'.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Motae</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Motae means the origin.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The origin?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, origin.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Everything is reborn through the origin (what are in their origin). If somebody is a human being, then they just understand they're human beings in past. And I reborn because</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>I means general people</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>reborn from the past (and they departed from the past and reborn). But, it is not easy for anyone to perceive their past life because they departed from the past life. But it is very easy for people to know who they were from the present self (present selves). Because everything that happened that existed in them appeared again and again (again and again from their behaviors). They should see their past from their present behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well in&hellip; I&hellip; yeah, cause this is an often debated question about past lives and rebirth and reincarnation, but I am not really interested in that question, I'm interested in how I can be the best possible person right now in this time. My past lives, if there were past lives, that's already taken care of, I don't have to do anything about that. I do have to do something about this life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>This life&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>It might be the most important thing for you is that to make you be Enlightened and make good you in the future. (This is the most important thing for you in the present)</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well it's the classic purpose in Buddhism&hellip; to try to be Enlightened, to try to liberate your mind from your conditioning&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Only Buddha could guide people's living, so when we speak good teaching we shouldn't teach in just a similar way (We shouldn't speak in similar way). When we speak something we should point out the very clear problem and after that we should tell the result of that. When we see things in this point, the people who contact the existing Buddhism practice very dangerous things. The other religions always make God stand. That's why when the intelligent people see other religions, there's not so much teachings in them. But Buddha's teachings are different than that. Because Buddha suggested the principle how this world is run. That's why if people contact the Buddhism in wrong way they are easily deceived by that. I met so many people in Thailand this time and I found many things that I was very surprised about. I will not meet the monks (Buddhist monks) and Buddhist scholars again. I found that the Buddhist monks and Buddhist scholars do many very dangerous things. You may met many of monks, that's why if I speak you, then you will understand what is the modern Buddhist (Buddhism) teachings (what do they teach). Thailand Buddhism speaks about meditation as the first step and the second is Buddhist scriptures. Third is precepts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Is it all right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, well yeah, the basic teachings, the Four Noble Truths and the Precepts, those are&ndash; that's where you start.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip; meditation, scriptures, precepts&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Please remember, I'll tell you why what they do is dangerous. If people sit down and they make their consciousness sleep, then the healthy people will lose themselves very quickly, and weak people will admit (to receive) the dead spirits. If people follow their guidance,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>"Their" means Thai Buddhist monks</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then this is like they kill their own soul. Then, why people regard that meditation is so important for them is because this is easiest way the dead spirits can enter to people's body. And the dead spirits always use the religion. The spirit that enter to human's body through the meditation (practice of meditation) they also use religion and they conquer people's body and consciousness. The problem is that when they are conquered by others' spirits they don't live by themselves but they act what the ghost want. In this case, they can't be reborn as human beings. When they die, they feel the great attachment to living and they try again to enter the human's body. The spirits who work (acted) in human's body, they find it impossible to reborn as human beings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The&hellip; uh&hellip; yeah, I don't&hellip;. The word spirits, it's not in my vocabulary in the sense of that, but it would seem the basic Buddhist teaching teaches meditation because the opposite, that the way the spirits come in is through your attachments and the way you get beyond that is by doing meditation and spirits have no ground to stand on. So I think what's being and what I would tend to believe is that it's my attachment, it's my conditioning, that allows, if you want to use the word, spirits to come in and be negative and do all&hellip; you know, anger, whatever. And that's in meditation that you actually relieve yourself of the spirits and they don't have a place to attach. So I think, actually, what I understand is the opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm..</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>The evils always speak &ndash; it sounds very nice. Because I knew you visit me today, in the morning, I put you in (in me). You are good person but &ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Do you understand, he says that "put you in"&hellip;.&nbsp; "(in him)"&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well I understand the words&hellip; I'm not sure how you do that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Like a computer, you know? We put in you and he found that you are a good person. It means that you have a good basis. <strong>*continues to interpret for Tathagata* </strong>But because you contacted the meditation and scriptures (books), but that's why you are in level of danger now.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I didn't meet you in the morning but I could read you (see you). Then if you wonder about this, you can test me.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> I met you (Soyun has met you) and I (Soyun) told the Master Tathagata about you. So, Master's consciousness is like an electric wave. So, through me (through Soyun) He could see you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah&hellip; a lot of communication happens that way. I do have questions in the sense that meditation is dangerous and Buddhist precepts and Four Noble Truths and so on, if they're dangerous, what is the alternative to ask people to do if they want to purify or see through their conditioning and be liberated &ndash; what is the alternative? I mean cause Buddhism says meditation is one of the basic practices that you should do. So you need alternatives if you say no meditation. What do you tell people to do?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>For people's living, the proper exercise and working is the best. That's the best teaching for human's health: proper working and proper exercise.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah well if when you say proper, one of the key words in Buddhism is "mindful", and I would&hellip; I like the Eightfold Path, you know, right action, and so on. What is proper? What is the whole understanding of work &ndash; of the work you're doing, the work I was doing today? Uh&hellip; so that calls for mindfulness and I would agree that everyday life is your best practice. I mean you practice with your life &ndash; your whole life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>We need a standard to measure what is right and proper. For example, if we go to optician, then they have a picture</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> A chart</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>to measure our eye function. Like this, we put the standard to judge what is right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> You put the what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Measure&hellip; ah&hellip; standard. To judge what is wrong, what is right. Standard is 'what is'&hellip; 'what is'.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Even though the same object, but we can see in different way according their eyesights. In order to practice to carry out properly Eightfold Path, then the first thing we need to do is to awake ourselves. All the answers is decided by question (by problems). We need to learn first what kind of result expected by what matter. But when I see the Eightfold Path in the modern Buddhism, in scriptures, then I can't find the way in that teaching. In any teachings, the ways exist in the problems. We need to know first of all why people can't practice Eight path, because what they couldn't aware of to practice them, and Buddhist monks always speak this Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path first (They always speak this first.) because they have only one aim to use this. This is to deceive others. When they speak this, people don't realize that they are deceived. Even though they are deceived they don't realize that. When I observe their teachings</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>He means that modern Buddhist monks' teachings</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then it is more dreadful than the robbers and swindlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well the Eightfold Path is basically meaningless unless you apply it real situations in your life. I mean, you can say, I mean, I've been part of those teachings and have contributed sometimes or listened other times, and they're always very abstract until you say, right action, well then you take an action, a karmic action, and you bring it together with that principle, then you can see some truth. Alone, which I agree: too many monks and too many teachers just keep saying "Eightfold Path, Eightfold Path, Eightfold Path&hellip;" but it&hellip; it's meaningless&hellip; until you apply it to your life, to life direct&ndash; directly to life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So that's like Master said, to practice them, we need to awake</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yea</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>We need to be aware of 'what is' first</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>And secondly, I would like to tell about the scriptures (Buddhist scriptures) &ndash; why are Buddhist scriptures bad. Any food will protect our body when you eat them when it's fresh. But no matter how nourish food, when they go bad, if you eat them, then it will harm our health.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, that's very interesting because&hellip; it's a very interesting analogy&hellip; because I totally agree that if you just take things that are written down and communicate them in a dead way, or just as memory, that's poison, I agree, that you need to receive the teachings fresh.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> And you do that through your life,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> through your experiences. And that's why Buddhism to me is not a religion where it goes away from life, it's actually a religion that takes you right in the middle of your life in a very direct way, and mindful way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>And the teachings made truth are the same like this. The deteriorated truth is like the poison (is like the bad food). In sutra, they didn't write <em>exactly</em> what Buddha taught (what Buddha said). Instead, they rewrite (rewrote) through their what they wanted.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The sense that um&hellip; Buddha himself said to his followers "Don't take my &ndash; don't take the writings, don't take other monks word, you have to experience it directly, you have to experience it through your own life, your own mind. " And I&hellip; that is a wonderful statement by a spiritual leader that don't &hellip; and I think he was warning precisely about this problem &ndash; cause it's not fresh anymore. After 2,500 years it's not fresh. That you have to somehow go after the freshness of the message, and that can only be done through your own mind, your own experience, your own life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If people receive everything in the scriptures, this is just like they eat the deteriorated food. If people are once poisoned, then they refuse, they can't receive the restorative (tonic). In fact, it is almost impossible to transfer the right Buddha's teaching in Thailand. That's why I just sit in hotel room. I decided that I will not meet again the Buddhist monks or professors in Thailand. Most of Thai people and the intelligent people support the monks. After I saw all the reality, I realized that I shouldn't come here (I regret). And today, I meet you, so I would like to ask you&hellip; I'll remove everything dead in you, because you received them because you didn't know, but you received, they stay in you. And I can help you fresh and good soul revive in you. What do you think? Make yourself realize and show good self (good yourself)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I think eventually it's each person's responsibility to seek that freshness and that's what the search for Enlightenment is about, it's about seeking that freshness of experience, openness of experience, connected to the universe &ndash; the whole connection. But that has to be done by each individual, it really can't be done, I don't think, by somebody outside the individual. They can help, they can share, they can suggest, they can guide, but eventually it comes back to the person themselves having to do the work of Enlightenment.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's right. But when we know the right way, it's very easy for us to make ourselves realize and attain Enlightenment. You are considerably intelligent person, but with your current theory and knowledge, it's very difficult for you to work in this stage of the world. But in case you stay with me and you observe me what I do and you listen to me, then within two years you can be the best debater in this world. In order to be the best debater in this world, whatever you speak must keep the right side.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: "</strong>Just", you know? Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You should tell anything just to the principle of the world. If you spend one year with me, then what you think that you know (you know something, your existing knowledge) will be disappeared, and after two years you start to see the world, and whatever you talk has the reason and justice so it will agree with the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I don't want to be the best debater in the world&hellip;. I &ndash; once you set up a goal like that, it shapes things, your expectations shape things, I just want to &ndash; I address the problem or the situation in front of me, and if that calls for me to debate, I do the best I can. But the idea of setting up a goal as the best or this&hellip; you know, it's like setting up a goal for Enlightenment. I don't set up that goal for Enlightenment. I try to live Enlightened ways every moment and sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but I think once you set up goals like that or measurements I think it takes you off the path. You know, and, I've already learned several things from this conversation that have been very valuable so I really appreciate those things I learned, but I learn things from the whole universe. The whole universe is my teacher. And so I appreciate the teachings being offered and I have learned already some things that are very valuable that I can use and incorporate. But, I&hellip; I&hellip; I&hellip; I use everybody, every teacher that comes into my life, I try to learn from that person or that thing or, a bird, or a tree, or whatever.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I agree with you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> What?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>"I agree with you."</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I didn't completely finished even primary school. That's why until 17 years old, I didn't understand well that the word that society communicates. This is very funny episode&hellip; In one test, they said that you write down the&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Um&hellip; what is the&hellip; ant-&hellip; not similar&hellip; what's that? What is the word? If it's happiness, the unhappiness. What is the connection? I forgot the&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposite. Antonym? The opposite how you call it in English</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Paradox?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Not paradox&hellip; happiness, unhappiness&hellip; long, and short.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, they're opposites&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposites or antagonists.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> But they're useful in Buddhism. Buddhism uses paradox all the time</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposites</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Opposites, to gain the truth&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So it means that he even didn't know the very basic, basic way of communicate in society.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I do want to mention, I read the book very carefully.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> And his story is very touching&hellip; touching of the heart. The struggle, you know, that's a very beautiful story and I just want to mention it.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But that time was much easier than this time.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> A bigger goal&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (laughing): </strong>At that time, I had to solve only my own mouth. But now, I have two more, and in London, maybe five. I have to support them also. But I can't work to make money because it is more urgent thing to awake human beings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I have to prepare all the expenses for this and I have to awake people but nobody receive me. Whenever I try to awake people, but they expelled me. I had hardship when I was young, when I was very, very hungry, I had to fill my stomach with water. But now I find it more difficult to stand the people's cold reception and everybody turn away from me. In spite of people's such attitude, I never forget this world even one day. This is my best teaching to remain for human beings. So I'm trying every day in order to find out one person among one million.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Master Tathagata):</strong> Hehe&hellip; So, Master asks you, How much salary do you have? If you don't mind&hellip; per month&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> A modest salary&hellip; Thirty-five thousand baht.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Thirty-five&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Thousand baht.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Thousand baht.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Baht.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> About 850, maybe, dollars&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, 850&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Just enough to live on.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>That's too small salary&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's too small salary compared to your work. How much can you save except your residence and food&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, I receive social security from the States &ndash; The United States &ndash; my government pension, which is around 40 thousand. So I try to save that for emergencies, or medical, or&hellip; if I got very sick I would have to go back to the United States where I have the medical &ndash; senior medical plan. So, I mean I can take care of small things here but if I really got sick, or seriously, I would have to go back to the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>How old are you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> 68.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (after translating):</strong> You look very young&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> You look young.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> It's interesting&hellip; Age is interesting, because I know lots of people who don't want to tell their age or they make it younger, but your age is very much part of your karmic path. That's where I am. I mean, my job is not to be 55, or 34, my job is to be a very good 68.</p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*Satto begins laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The best I can be &ndash; 68. And next year I get to be the best I can be 69. So, I don't regret, or I don't try to say I'm younger or whatever. I am very honest about my age because I think once you start fudging that, or not being clear about that, you lose your karmic path, you lose your path. It becomes very delusionary. So I'm very pleased to be 68.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughs and then translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Haven't you think about this &ndash; you spend the rest of your life for very worthy thing?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's my life. That's my commitment&hellip;. I'm not interested in making a lot of money, or&hellip; I'm just interested in contributing. That's my intention, basically from a Buddhist perspective. And if I can help the world in some way, that's my goal. So, that's why I'm here away from my family&hellip; my family, my two children, my two grandchildren, are in New Jersey. I see them once a year, and my sons don't understand why I'm here&hellip; "Why not come back? Be grandfather?"</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Be grandfather&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> Master says,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I look very poor, not so great, my appearance, but I can perceive everything in all the fields: economy, politics, medicine, science, philosophy. I have ability to understand all the fields in the world. If I can use a little of my ability, then I can prepare everything for doing this work (this mission). So I would like to suggest you one thing, so please tell me very frankly. I can provide the good shelter and foods and pocket money to you. How about you? Would you be my advisor to do this work for the world, for good thing? If you can admit (agree) with my suggestion, I'll compensate everything for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I don't&hellip; I don't need compensation. I mean I have my life sort of worked out enough that I can support myself, but my job is to help people spread Buddhist words, so I'm available to help anybody, I mean, that's my job to do that. So, but I don't need anybody supporting me or when I get sick and die I guess I will go back to my children, or I'll die here, or die in Thailand. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (laughing):</strong> It doesn't matter&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But what you do now is not right. We should see the result by the problems. We can't see the result from our thinking.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well my thinking is part &ndash; the problems and my thinking merge and I try to do the best I can, and that's my job. And, I disagree, I am doing what I need to do. This has been &ndash; this position has been given to me by the universe to do what I can, and I will do &ndash; I will continue to do what I can within the _________ University. That's my job right now, and I will move ahead with that and do the best I can. My intent is to help Buddhist principles be understood and used in the world, and the university gives me that opportunity.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>To awake, to call your attention, I mentioned about the food (fresh food and bad food). The modern Buddhism gives people poison. So, if you really want to work in that job continuously, then you should bet your soul. Everybody needs a great courage to listen to me and approach to me. That's why I suggested that I will compensate for you if you admit my suggestions, and listen how do I compensate for you (what is the content). Your soul is poisoned by much of something wrong. Because of that, in your</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>This part</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>chest, you have much of bad energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, I don't believe in a soul, that's a word, so that can be defined in many ways. So, we're dealing with communication here, so soul may just be a communication problem. But I don't use the word soul, I have an impermanent, conditioned self, and I agree that like every other impermanent, conditioned self, it has fallacies, it has ignorance, it has delusion. And I work to clarify that. But, as I work to clarify that, I also do the best I can with what I know to share with people, and that's my job.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>According to my observation in the morning (I observed you), during our conversation, you should show something strange symptom but you are still very normal. You are already controlled by some power but you don't express that. Now I am confused who I talk to.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I am controlled by the power of the universe, I really believe that, and the more I see through my conditioning, the more I see through my illusion or ignorance, then the more I am controlled by that force in the universe. And, that's why I don't see where, that's why I said when we first sat down that I don't see where I chose this job. This job &ndash; this situation &ndash; chose me, that I'm here, I'm working here because the universe is choosing me to do this work.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If you can admit my suggestion and if you can become my advisor for this mission, then I'll let the force that controls you to achieve his or her wish. If I don't help him or her to achieve their wish, then they will not let you be free. The choice looks very simple, but this world is not going just by our minds. If you can come near me, you will be the advisor of a Messiah of this age. Instead, if you make just what you do now and you keep your working right now, then you will be the servant of the devil.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Whatever.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Whatever&hellip; Hehe.<strong> *translates for Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I, you know&hellip; You're making this thing as an attachment. I am happy to not succeed, to succeed, to succeed highly, to be totally frustrated. All those are acceptable to me. I don't put attachment into &ndash; I want it to be this way, I want to be that way, that's not good Buddhism. Buddhism teaches you to accept what is, what is happening, and I'm willing to accept what happens. I think that probably comes from more age &ndash; at 68, I, you know, I could die tomorrow. Anybody could die tomorrow. But it's very important not to get into this attachment realm &ndash; that you'll give me this, and I will give you that &ndash; I &ndash; no, I am an advisor. If you wanted me to be an advisor I can be an advisor, but within my role at the university. That's what I do. I advise. I share. I learn. I've learned today. So, it's very good. I can use some of the insight for other people. So that's my job, so I'm certainly willing to be an advisor but I don't want support, I don't want the attachment. You're not my teacher. You are my teacher. You're my teacher, and you're my teacher. And the world is my teacher. So.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If we make good fruit (good result) from what we do, this is good. But what we do is collected to bad result then this is bad thing. Then, the Thailand Buddhism could prosperous like this without falsehood? So I am very anxious because the person like you live with hypocrites and live in falsehood, and the end of the world is decided. I can state very clearly at the risk of my life. Whoever engaged to religion deeply &ndash; any religions deeply &ndash; cannot be saved. I guarantee my statement with my life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah. The job of people who engage in spiritual path and teach as best they can is to live with hypocrites, is to live in the lion's den &ndash; Daniel in the Lion's Den &ndash; classic Christian story, where we need to live among hypocrites. That's where our job is. That's where our work is. It's not among the Enlightened people. If Avalokitesvara, he could have gone to Enlightenment, and he said, "No, I need to stay to work with people till everybody's Enlightened." So I believe in the Bodhisattva ideal, I believe in that challenge, and my job is to live with people who lie and cheat and do things wrong and destroy their lives. That's my job, and I don't try to avoid that. I don't try to live other than live with people as they are and try to improve, to improve, try to encourage them to use Buddhist teachings, other religious teachings, universal, spiritual teachings in their lives. Cause we need that type of world. We need the world where people are using universal spiritual princi&ndash; teachings&hellip; freshly &ndash; in a fresh way.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I speak very clearly here: Buddhism has nothing to do with all the Buddhas. I was in the center of Buddhas before I came to the world. But when I came to this world and when I tried to awake Buddhists, there's no one who treated even one glass of water to me. Unless you realize that you don't see the world correctly (you don't realize the world) then your knowledge will drive you to the edge of danger. I came into the world to save this, but I haven't done anything, I haven't achieved anything, just only make me in painful and suffering situations. You don't need to speak about the Bodhisattvas. The most important thing is that what has happened really. The Bodhidharma, who was the 28th&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Went to China&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, went to China&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>and at that time, the Buddhism in India was become disappeared, but in China, the Buddhism prosperous. But Dharma was one person who received right teaching at that time, and when he came to China, the emperor received him. But the emperor saw a very poor monk came, but he was the 28th dharma, so he respect (emperor respect) the monk and he gave a question to him. Emperor said, "I build several tens of thousands temples and I support numerous monks and I published so many Buddha scriptures, then how about my virtue?" Then Dharma said only one word, "Nothing."</p>

<p style=""><strong>*some begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's good Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>So, no matter how you may try to spread Buddhism, then your virtue is nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> But that's okay. That's okay. There's a very famous story which I like very much, of a monk &ndash; the local rich person, or the emperor, gives the money to build a temple, gives him gold, and the monk goes ahead and builds the temple, but the emperor doesn't hear, or the head person doesn't hear, and he goes to the monk and says, you know, "I gave you money, you built the temple, and I don't get any gratitude. Where's my gratitude?" And the monk turned to him and said, "The giver should be grateful." So&hellip; when you give, that's all you need to do. You just need to give. You just need to do your best and share and give and teach. That is enough. It doesn't matter what the result is. Hopefully, the result will be good, good karma, and will help people. But it doesn't&ndash; you don't &ndash; you can't be attached to the result. You just have to be attached to your process of Enlightenment.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughs quietly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The rest takes care of itself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip; that's what the monks interpret. That's not&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No, that's what I interpret.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>You interpret&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That is my interpretation.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>But most of the monks&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I put it through my mind and my experience.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah&hellip; monks in general interpret like this about this story. They always use this story very, very badly. So just listen to him&hellip; he didn't say about the&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He didn't finish</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>The meaning</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> The meaning, yes, of this story.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's your misunderstanding. The truthful person always say things very exactly.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Right or wrong, or even, this is 1, 1 is 1, 2 is 2. So very clear, everything is very clear.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Today, I met you, and we spent time to talk, and I really wanted to laugh about the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*as Tathagata speaks, Soyun begins to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So he speak the reason he wants to laugh very loudly</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Because, in this world, there's no monks who is better than you. Then, from whom you can learn Buddhism? It's better for you to teach Buddhism by yourself. You can teach others then it will be virtue of you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, that's&hellip; that's&hellip; thank you. I'll think about that&hellip;. I have to go. It's been a very long day for me. I've been up since 5:30.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Oh! haha&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I've been thinking very hard all day</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, thinking very hard all day&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> and my mind now is &ndash; it's&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> It's mush.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English, as Soyun translates):</strong> Okay, okay, okay&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I need to go have a beer.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Beer&hellip;!</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Let my mind float&hellip; but please express my appreciation. I've, actually it's been very informative and I learned a lot, and I'm always happy to be &ndash; have my ideas tested and suggestions and so on, so, I'm very open to that, and I want to thank you very much.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Everything in this world is determined, that's why no one can break the appointment. That's why I also lead my living very lonely. I hope you will have good fortune.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Through all my life, I can say that I never cheated others, I never steal, I never harm others, and everything that I do has reason (right reason). When new world come, my activities will brighten this world for 1,000 years.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well we should all wish each other good luck&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It was very nice to see you today.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Thank you. And thank you, both of you, for being so dedicated.</p>
