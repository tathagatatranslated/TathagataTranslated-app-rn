<h3>Explanation about the subjects of death, the world after life, and transmigration</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Question from member:</strong> Can I ask a question? I'm looking to find out about a couple of things. One of them is &ndash; I'm curious to find out about death. I'd like to find out about the process&hellip; what happens?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Master Tathagata): </strong>After death?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Well, death itself. The activity of the body stops. What happens?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Master Tathagata:</strong> At the moment our body stops to act we feel very, very comfortable. After for a while, our soul comes out from our body.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*After a few minutes during which someone is typing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Four kinds of phenomena appear when people die.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So we feel comfortable and then the activity of the body ceases, or the activity of the body ceases &ndash; stops &ndash; and our soul stays and feels comfortable, is that&hellip; which one? Or both?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Even though the soul stays in the body, stopped all the activities&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> The body stopped, yeah ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But the soul feels very, very comfortable. It feels like we are free from all the burden.&nbsp; But the soul doesn't realize it's dead. One phenomenon is that when people die then the soul feels like they fall into the very, very deep sleeping, and they forget everything. In that situation, the soul is reborn very quickly. And the next phenomenon is like the situation that they sleep very, very peacefully. And the fourth is to reach to Heaven. They preserve their consciousness in the excellent comfortable situation. But one phenomenon that I mentioned that they feel comfortable, they feel like they let down all the burdens, but they don't feel they're dead. In this case, they find it difficult to be reborn.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*After a few minutes during which another conversation takes place&hellip;*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>So, what are the four phenomena? The first one: get comfortable, feel sleepy, and then, the soul goes to sleep, and he's reborn, rapidly, you said. Then, the second one, they lie back, let go of all their burdens,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (sound engineer):</strong> Sorry?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>There were four things,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> The second one, I didn't understand</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>Yeah that's what I'm trying to clarify&hellip;. The second one, let go of their burdens, lie back, feel sleepy, let go, but then don't think that they're dead. So I'm guessing that's where the whole ghosts business comes around. And then, the fourth one, their consciousness remains intact and they go to Heaven. But what's the third one? I missed one.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>Ask again&hellip; explain again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata and Soyun are speaking*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> First, there are four ways after death, right. The first dimension is that they die, even though they're still in the dead body, they feel they're very comfortable, like let down all the burdens, but they don't feel they died, so that's why they feel they fall into deep sleep. Then they're easy to reincarnate &ndash; they can be reborn.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> But the second&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Which takes, how long, generally? Is that a quick process, or it can take a long time?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> It depends on their Karma. In this case, they can be reborn, anyway.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm, okay. Anyway.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> But the third, is that they go to the eternal life. They feel that they are in very comfortable sleeping and then they go to eternal life. And, he explained that, they also feel very, very comfortable condition, very comfortable like extremely nice dream. But they still have their own consciousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> They are aware.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. Their own consciousness. Then they can go to the Heaven.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> And the fourth?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> They are four. One is they can be caught by the world of grudge, of the ghost. Then second, they can reborn (reincarnate). Third, is eternal life dimension, and the Heaven. When they are very, very pure, then they can go to Paradise.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So what's the difference between Heaven and Paradise?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Heaven still belongs to this Earth</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> It's connected</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> But Paradise is completely different, this is completely free from these three dimensions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Oh okay, so Heaven and Paradise are not connected.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Connected &ndash; different dimensions. But according to Master, Heaven itself is not so high dimension. This is the middle level between the supreme dimension, to this Earth. So, people say Heaven, but Heaven is not so high. Even in Heaven, there are some bad plots because the gods in Heaven also are influenced by the gods here.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Hm, interesting.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In the second dimension.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Sorry, this is the second dimension?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes. The ghosts' dimension is first, then the human beings' dimension is second.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>Then what, Heaven third, and Paradise fourth, I take it.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm, eternal life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, Paradise is really, really good place. All the Buddhas stay there and even some Bodhisattvas, even though they didn't reach the Perfect Enlightenment, they also can go when they have power to stop the activities of their Karma, it is possible to reach the Paradise.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>So any Enlightened Beings go directly to the fourth dimension.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, fourth dimension.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So, it's been written I guess, or been said, that before you die, your life flashes before your eyes, you see your whole life. Is that not the case?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, because we didn't heard from the person who experienced that. Master never mentioned about that. Master doesn't answer before he sees that, or he meet the person who experience that by themselves. At least we need to hear from them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> What about the Creator?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Who, or what, is the Creator?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> According to Master's teaching, the Creator is 100% pure energy. Buddha still has mercy and love for people but the Creator doesn't have even mercy or love. So this is perfect pure consciousness only.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So what's the Creator's relationship to the world of origin?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> It only created the law (principle) and everything is created by the principle. So, Creator didn't create any butterflies or elephants or&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>So what, the creator is the foundation?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm, foundation. So, we can say that it only created (made) the law&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> The conditions</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, and everything evolved upon the law.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm, okay&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, the law means it is the law of repetition.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah. Well that pretty much answers my question. So the Creator really doesn't have a relationship with humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, no, never. Even Buddha doesn't have relationship with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> With the Creator.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mhm. It is absolutely independent.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> It's a force.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. So it is the real core of the universe. It stays in the center of the universe. So even the highest gods can't approach that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Aha&hellip; Well, there we go.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Master still doesn't know the secret of Creation. If someone knows the law of creation, they also create things.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mm, I see.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Even Buddha can't create even a small plant</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> We say, "manifest"&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Manifest.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> M-A-N-I-F-E-S-T.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Manifest. Manifest a plant</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, okay. Well if that's the case, many people are wrong about many things. Okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> We've heard that in Oxford every year they have a meeting to debate about Creationism and evolutionism.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>Where?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In Oxford</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Oh.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> City. So we</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Every year?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. We were very interested in</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> To attend</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> in attend there. For Tathagata, it is so simple to speak about that. But they have debated long, long years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So then how do human beings actually come to exist, if we weren't created by the Creator, or the force that we refer to as the Creator?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> If he want to find that, he must go back long, long way&hellip; million years.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So human beings have been around for a while, then&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> If you ask those questions to others, then it's like I want to tell a lie &ndash; I want to listen to a lie. Nobody can answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Not even Tathagata&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Even Tathagata, if he has to know that, he must go to million years ago&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Back&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Back&hellip; mm. So it's useless.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Hah&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Too far away.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Sorry?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Too far, hehe&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Guess it doesn't really matter, does it ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hm&hellip;. It doesn't matter. The best wisdom for ordinary people is to know fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Hm&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Because Socrates spoke that sentence, "Know yourself." That's why Master admits that he was a Saint and a great philosopher.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Ah! That's the last question I wanted to know! What about people who commit suicide?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; even though they commit suicide, they can't free from their action because they have another Karma that they committed suicide &ndash; they killed self.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, even though it kill the body, they didn't kill their soul. That's why only the Karma put on their consciousness</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> More&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> though &ndash; More.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> A bigger debt</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> To beat the Karma, they kill themselves. So when they're reborn, they commit those things again.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So the Japanese have got it wrong, then ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> That's why only stupid things. Even though they kill their body, they can't touch their soul, only their behavior put in their soul.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> I don't know if the Japanese wants&ndash; because it's not because they hate, it's because they have a kind of&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Oh, it's a ritualistic thing, I understand that, but suicide is suicide, if that's the case&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Even though they stay in the world of ghosts, they are deeply suffered from their behavior. They will fall in the world of grudge, maybe they will stay in the dimension of ghosts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So it make them very, very miserable for long, long time.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*some time passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> I might have more questions, but I'll send them to the Hotmail&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Ask, if you&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>No, no, it's&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>She heard many things.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, no, no, no, it's not that, Satto, it's just what I've heard sort of stuffed me up a little bit. So I need to rework a couple of concepts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, that's a question. Of the four possibilities, what determines which outcome occurs?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Outcome of?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Of the four, is it something&hellip; well, I'm gonna state the obvious I guess. I take it as the way of the life that you live. Is it as simple as the life that you live leading up to your death determines which of the four things occur, or is it something else?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> I don't understand&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Um, say for example, I live my whole life as a murdering, rapist thief.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hehe okay&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Right? Because I've spent my life being a murderer-rapist-thief, does that mean that I'll be&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> According to their Karma, if they have heavier Karma, then it's</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Then it's more likely</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, it means they have more ignorance, and attachment, greed, grudge, then they can't reincarnate.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So it's more probable they'll be ghosts</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes. It's very simple principle. In this world, everything that is light floats higher, and heavy just comes down. So, if their karma is heavier then it will come down, so their karma is very light, then they go up. Same reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Okay. Now, so if we die, and we don't become a ghost, and we don't be reborn, and we go to heaven, then, are we reborn again or is it only if we choose, or do we have to be reborn periodically?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So&hellip; Why Buddha taught very much for people was because the last thing you obtain through your life is grudge. And when you have grudge, then your mind entangled by them, and when you die, your mind can't scatter. So you keep your mind even though you die, and mind works.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata speaks to Soyun*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> But if you're reborn, they must repeat the life cycle according to their karma. Even though they don't want to be unhappy, but they can't, they are not free from their karma. But the third dimension, eternal life, we are free and we can decide our own destiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So we don't have&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> If I want to be born as a king, I can be, if I want to be born as a very poor man, then I can choose that destiny.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> And if you don't want to at all?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>But nothing forever&hellip; even some soul go to paradise, they can stay there several thousand years, but they have to come back again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>They have to?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes. Because in paradise there's nothing to accumulate virtue more because everything is good. No evil.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Right.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So that's why they come back here again to accumulate virtue.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Heh. So it's not that the virtue diminishes?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes. So they become the owner of their destiny.&nbsp; They are free from Karma. Still they have Karma, but they can control themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Mm..</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So they obtained freedom. Only they can stay in that dimension for several hundred years.&nbsp;</p>
