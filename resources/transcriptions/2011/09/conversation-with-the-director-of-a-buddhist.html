<p style=""><strong>Tathagata: </strong>I came to Thailand</p>

<p style=""><strong>Director:</strong> Came from Korea?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> because I wanted to be helpful for your people. But still I can't give any help to these people.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> He came from London, England.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So I'm not sure when I come back to this country again if we are leaving this time&hellip;. I am leaving this country with one question. I still don't understand why you only try to learn meditation that's wrong, but you don't try to learn Buddha's teaching that is so good?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> This is his question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Director:</strong> Then&hellip; what do you mean that&hellip; of learning meditation is not good, but learning Buddha's teaching is good.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, so good, no problem&hellip; but meditation is the cause of lots of problems</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> What is the problem with that?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Meditation is activities that you call the dead people enter to your body.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> When they practice meditation, then this is the way that they let the dead souls come in.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You don't know me&hellip;. When I see things, I can see all the problems that are in the thing and I can see the result of the problems. If you deny my words I show you (I suggest you) all the evidences. If somebody speaks something to me with their understanding, then they also should show me the evidences of their knowledge.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> What I'm wondering is that the difference between meditation and the Buddha teaching &ndash; what do you mean by that, what is the difference? Because Buddha teach also meditation, not only teachings something else a path from meditation, because meditation is one step forward &ndash; one step to reach Enlightenment. Without meditation, you cannot reach Enlightenment in the Buddha teachings.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In the Buddha's teachings</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> This&ndash; this is&hellip; to me!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip; to you. You understand like this.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yeah. Because one is <em>sila</em>, or we can say that cultivation of ethical conduct that is the beginning&hellip; the basic&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> There's no one who could attain Enlightenment by meditation or no one who could be devote helpful to society by practice meditation. So, many meditation is the only way to receive the dead souls and lose themselves. I stake my life if these words are wrong. The truth must be verified by the proof. So if a person like you are not interested in checking this truth, then in this country, who will want to check? We just came back from confirmation. We've just met meditation master and I found (I saw) there were many of dead souls in his body. I told him, "You have many of souls in you." He denied.&nbsp; So I answered him, "What do you obtain from meditation?" "Peace." And when we talked there were 5 people together. But his face was worst among 5 people and his face itself was very dark. So if the meditation is really good then the appearance (the result) must come the opposite way. The fact is like this. Then how can you show us (how can you verify for us) that is good?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> See&hellip; In the Buddhist way, Buddhism, Buddha explained the way which are eight all together, eight factors&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Eight factors</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yes. Which is called the middle way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Middle way</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What is middle way?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> In the middle way, the middle way, the middle between the two. There are two other ways which people used to follow before Buddha found this middle way. One is the way to enjoy life &ndash; enjoy material things &ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip; enjoy material things&hellip; heh</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And the other way is to harm oneself.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> To..?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Harm, to harm</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> To harm self</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Because sometimes some people do like harming oneself, and not having food, you know, sitting for meditation without food and things, maybe for a long, long time. And these are two extreme ways in Buddhist point of view.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Are you telling a story for me or are you explaining Buddha's teaching?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Explaining the Buddha's teaching! Explaining the way, the Buddhist way&hellip; What I am going to talk is the Buddhist way. But you say, what are the other ways,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But there are two ways before that. When Buddha himself found another way which is called the middle one.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When you say middle way, then what do you mean by that? There are three ways. Then you should go that one way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> In the middle</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In the middle&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Not too much of enjoying life&hellip; okay&hellip; when you need food, you need clothes for your living, okay, material things you need to have that, but not to enjoy&hellip;. Not to enjoy, not to attach to that. You cannot attach of the color of your clothes but you know you use the cloth to protect your body from the heat, the cold, from the wind. That is the way. That is the Buddhist way. But not to attach to it</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Attach to this&hellip; ah</p>

<p style=""><strong>*while Soyun is translating for Tathagata, someone knocks, enters, and speaks briefly to the director in Thai, and then in English*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Newcomer:</strong> Hello&hellip; You are from?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>&hellip; From Korea, England&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Newcomer:</strong> Ah, from Korea, England, also, I see&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Therefore we need to have, but not to attach. Okay? And we need to control, but not to harm. We need to observe the rule and regulation for our living, but not to attach and not to harm ourselves. That's what the middle is. Not too extreme both way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's very interesting to talk to you but we don't think we can detain (hold) you for long time. So, do you mind if I try to awaken you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Awake&hellip; what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Awake what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> To make you realize that you don't know anything about Buddha's teaching.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Well, I think that I know many things about Buddha teaching. Because I need to have time to explain.&hellip; whether it is right in your understanding, or it is right isn't the same.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (amused):</strong> If you tell the truth to us then today you have great luck.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I came to Thailand one month ago and I searched all Bangkok for one month and I met so many monks, also Buddhist scholars, but I failed to meet someone who know Buddha's teaching. In order to meet someone who really know Buddha's teaching I gave a proposal. If there is one man who understands one thing of Buddha's teaching I decided to donate 10 million baht. Maybe today you will be the owner of that, maybe tomorrow I transfer my money to your account!</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> I personally do not like having more of wealth. Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Any more of ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Wealth, or money&hellip; I live a very simple life as a Buddhist monk. Buddha teach us to live with a very simple life with three roles&hellip; With food collecting from the door of the people as a beggar</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip; as a beggar</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And to live, you know, without hair&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; without hair</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But at the same time you sacrifice yourself to help others.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, that's good&hellip;&nbsp; Buddha's teaching must have ways in it, and Buddha always spoke cause makes effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of course. I agree!</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> I understand the same thing.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you have seen an elephant you should explain, you should be able to verify what an elephant is like to others. So, if that somebody can't like this, then we can't say he saw that &ndash; even though he saw that, he can't say he really saw that. Do you mind if I give you 10 questions, very simple questions, that we can read in the primary school textbook? We have a word, "happiness". What do you speak the happiness (for what)? If you have concern about the others' happiness, you should know about that. When you say happiness, what do you designate by that?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> The happiness is the state of mind&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> State of mind?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of your mind without attachment.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And, without</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata begins to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> the defilements: greed, hatred, and delusion.&nbsp; When you reach that state of the mind which is pure, and without defilements&hellip; the major defilements are: greed, without greed, liking to have people to understand what you want to, liking to have people, you know, to do something, or, liking to have this, and that, you know? Because liking to have more cause suffering. Therefore, we have less and finally we have no greed, no anger, hatred, and no delusion. These are the quality of the Buddha himself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Of Buddha himself</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Pure mind. The mind without defilements</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> There's no way in your answer. Nobody can arrive the state of happiness with such teaching. Okay, second is easier question&hellip;. In Buddha's teaching, we can meet the word, the truth. So what do you mean by that?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Truth, by truth?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; What do you designate by that word?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> There are two kinds of truth&hellip; in Buddhism. Ultimate truth, and the other one is just temporary understand by people, which is not real. And in other words, we can say that the truth which is very very important to understand, you know, to free ourselves from suffering or to reach what he said that&hellip; happiness&hellip; or whatever. &hellip; Peace. &hellip; And there are many truths which are not very important. Not very important for us to understand.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Not very important for you to understand?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> There are many, many other truths which are also the truth but not very important for us to understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You have too many of knowledge&hellip; so only when you leave (abandon, throw away) all of them, you will start to see Buddha's teaching.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D (laughs):</strong> Okay&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to learn the Buddha's teaching, to understand Buddha's teaching, but it is easy for you to deceive others by your knowledge. Okay. Third is easier than second. The word that people use most frequently is love. So what kind of things do you indicate by the word love ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Love is the&hellip; a kind of, what we call in Buddhism is the feeling</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Feeling&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And it is you know, if this feeling is not being controlled by insight wisdom, that maybe wrong&hellip; that may create wrong loving. Love. &hellip; Many of, you know, many of parents love their children and they love without wisdom and then they support them to do many bad things by loving them. They support them by giving them, you know, material things, money, and things, and they spoil them by that, by that loving. In Buddhism, if we consider love there must be control by wisdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's too difficult to understand what you speak. When you observe this world we cannot find any result without cause. And the result always is created by cause. So, if I ask you, what is the cause of such result, then you always give answer in very different direction. You don't need be ashamed because you can't answer to my questions. Since my Enlightenment, nobody could answer to my questions in this world. If you really know Buddha's teaching, when I speak to you the effect, you should perceive the cause of them. And when I ask you the cause (tell you cause), then you should perceive the result in that cause. And you haven't attained that level</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of course I myself can accept that, I did not attain&hellip; but, I'm trying as a Buddhist monk, I know personally that I still have greed, hatred, and delusion in my mind, but when I compare this to many of, you know, people, I can find that I am in a higher place than them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And in the Buddhist rule and regulation, if one reach enlightenment, you are not allowed to tell that to the public. It is prohibited and it is a very heavy, heavy com&ndash; I mean&hellip; a very heavy offense.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Offense</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And if one tell that to the public, he is no more monk, okay? He&ndash; that means he destroy his own monkhood. That is there in Buddhist rule and regulation.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It sounds very strange.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, it is in the Buddhist teaching. It is real Buddhist teaching. In the path of rule and regulation. And of course, there are two paths in Buddhist teaching. One is rule and regulation which monks and all Buddhists must observe. And the other one is the teaching that you must follow and try to practice and try to, you know, we have, according to what he taught&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When I listen to you, I misunderstand that I am in dreaming. When I listen to you, I feel I am dreaming because when Enlightened teacher come, he or she can teach what is wrong, what is right. So if the Enlightened being never tell -</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Teaching and telling is something different. Telling that you are attaining&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Enlightenment</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Enlightenment</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Only</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Or teaching what you understand is something different. You can teach something but not tell that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> According to your knowledge, then Gautama Buddha was very bad guy. And he called himself as Tathagata. When we say that I am Tathagata it means that I am a seer &ndash; I opened my eye &ndash; and I can see. And Tathagata means he attained the Supreme Enlightenment. So in Buddhist view, he was very bad because he even demanded others to call him as Tathagata, not Siddhartha. I would like to listen your opinion. In this present, is Thailand Buddhist work for the dead people or for living people?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Many, many questions&hellip; I personally, you know, understand the same thing that Tathagata, you know, who is attending the Supreme Enlightenment, I am agree. And one more thing, being the Tathagata, a Buddha, is something different from being the follower.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's right.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And we are the follower.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata starts to reply after translation*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But we can reach the same state of mind, what we call Enlightenment.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, you&hellip; sorry I didn't&ndash; I missed&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> See&hellip; we follow the same way, the middle way, which Buddha used to follow, and reach Enlightenment &ndash; Supreme Enlightenment &ndash; okay? And of course, we have the same quality of mind like the Buddha. But not the quality of reaching Enlightenment but not like him. Not <em>every</em> quality like him. Okay? Many of his disciples, you know, who did not reach Enlightenment says thing that "I'm reaching"&hellip; "Now I am here, Enlightenment, I am," you know, "being arahata," or what we call Enlightened people. In order to collect&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Collect&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong>&nbsp; fame&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Fame or money. It means they told lie</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Many, many, yeah, they tell lie, therefore Buddha laid down the rule and regulation. That is later!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> That is later ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> The rule and regulation&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Is made by others</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Is made by</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> By Buddha</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> The Sangha.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, by Sangha, not from Buddha.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Buddha as the leader and all of his disciples should be have this kind of rule. Yes we should have. And after them, after them, you know, no one can tell that "I'm the Enlightened one. I am capable as the Enlightened person." But you can teach the teaching of Buddhism.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I say myself I am the Enlightened, then is it wrong?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of course, if you're a Buddhist monk. If you're saying that "I'm a Buddhist monk", a follower of the Buddha, but if you say something "I am the great living beings" or "the great Buddha", it's something different</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Something different?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But if you are saying that I am the follower, the Buddha disciple, then you cannot say that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Aha&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Okay? If you're saying you're a Tathagata, you're a Buddha, you are free to do that. It's something different.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Can you explain what an Enlightenment is?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> I have already explained&hellip; The state of mind, reaching the state of mind without defilements.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Reaching the mind that is pure without defilements, without greed, without hatred, and without delusion. And the mind of compassion.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He has completed wisdom?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> He has a mind which is pure. Pure from what &ndash; pure from defilement. Okay? And he has a mind with insight wisdom. He has a mind with compassion. Okay. These are three quality of one who say that I am Buddha.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*After Tathagata speaks, Soyun laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You may feel my words is illusion but when I listen to you I just feel I am dreaming because I find your words are so illusionary. People speak whatever, but it's not right for them to speak something without proof or without witness (before they've seen). So, today, if the Buddhist monks say that I am the follower of Buddha then they should know even one thing of Buddha's teachings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> They should.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But I haven't met anyone who really wants to know Buddha's teaching properly and of course who knows Buddha's teaching. You gave us time to talk to you because you have good basis. But others are different from you. When I came to Thailand, I had the worst reception from professors in universities and the monks who has great fame. But when I walked Temple street then so many massage girls invited me <strong>*Satto laughs*</strong> and they say hello very kindly and hold my hand, even&hellip;. I found that their souls (of massage girls) are purer and cleaner than the souls of intellectuals and monk. So unless they smile at me then I probably already left this country. If I only pay 120 baht, then they give massage, give water and tea for one hour. And they are very kind and smile and offer many things. But I've never seen such phenomena through professors or monks. Everything in this world is predestined (is fixed). So the bad people never like good people. This is also fixed thing in this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Mm&hellip; hehe&hellip; Can you explain this fixed thing by explaining in connecting with the understanding of cause and effect? When you say it is fixed then it is something that when there's some cause, you know, when the cause of changing that kind of person to become good, you know, then it's impossible if it is fixed.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong>&nbsp; No, when cause change then the result will change as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> When you say fixed&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But in the circumstance that cause is not changed, it will not change. You are not worried about what to eat, where to sleep, by selling Buddha. If real Buddha come visit you what will you do to him?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> To me he will never come.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He will never come</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yes. Because he is beyond the world but we are still in the world. We are still in the world and he is beyond the world. He never, never come back and he always said&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He never come back&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Understanding his teaching is now you are seeing him&hellip; you are touching him.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Somebody can know only when they learn from teacher who knows but if they learn somebody who doesn't know, it's useless for 100 years, they're still in the state of ignorance. You've already had unbreakable barriers around you. It's true when Buddha has delivered himself from all the desires, then he is freed from rule of transmigration. But Buddha can come to this world again in the case of crisis of human beings. From today, I will hardly visit monks in Thailand to awake them but I would like to tell you truthfully who I am. I am in the manner of dignity in front of anybody because I can understand and I can perceive this world. But I am continue to travel around the world because I hope that I will find the way to help mankind.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Not finding&hellip; still not finding&hellip; Still searching?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In spite of all the cold reception of human being, I continue my effort. I know the way but nobody are looking that way. I was in the center of Buddhas in my past life. And what I want to tell you is selling Buddha is your freedom. (It's up to you to sell Buddha or not.) But don't think that you could approach real Buddha. I always have two kind of messages. One is that I inform people that I attained the Perfect Enlightenment. The other message is that I tell about myself: when I was born, and how did I grow up, and why I had to come to this world and what is the process of that and what is my mission and what I have to do in this world. I'll give you two messages so please read them with your friends and if you are interested whether it is true or not then please try to check. If you have interest in me, then I will pay reward about that. My first promise for you is that I'll open your wisdom. And I'll protect you from the influence of the devils. You should remember doing something good is more difficult than doing something bad. I was born in this human world to save this world, but until now, I've never welcomed by anyone. I've never welcomed by my parents, my brother, sisters, my relatives, and my friends. But, I live for them. You cannot test my abilities with your level of power. It is impossible for me if I didn't have the position of Buddha in the past. You've learned something from others but I never learn from others. When I was a child, I went to primary school for a while. At that time, I learned how to read, how to write, very carefully.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> From&hellip; from&hellip; from&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> From the primary school teacher, but nothing more than that</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But it's impossible for debating even though you have all the doctors or the intellectuals put together (but it's impossible between us to debate something). When somebody ask or somebody answer in this course we need to present the evidences</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Evidences and&hellip;<strong> *asks Tathagata in Korean*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Evidences in the questions.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Mm&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But it's impossible for human beings to do like this because they don't have Enlightenment. That's why nobody can answer to my questions. But if you ask me, I can realize anything, anytime. If somebody compare my ability to Gautama Buddha's, then this is a mistake. I think you as my friend so I will tell you who I was. My former being was Amida Buddha in the center of Paradise. So my former self was in the center of Buddhas. That's why I can know all the Buddha's teaching. I also can know the secret of this world that even other Buddha's didn't mention. I saw this current Buddhism, that's why when I die, I will tell to my people around me, "You shouldn't (you <em>never</em>) let me put the object of religion." Whatever you do has no relationship with Buddha. So no matter how you sell them, but what you do doesn't have any connection with any of Buddhas. If there is one thing that Buddha want from you it's that there even one of yours what you want to know what real Buddha teaching is. I only can tell by those Enlightenment you please devote and contribute to help people. Yesterday we arrived in this city&hellip; _______ [Transcription note: Couldn't get this entire sentence. @1:05:26]. Today we've met a few of monks so if I tried more to meet monks then it will make me sad.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*someone begins to laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So tomorrow we will contact the newspapers or broadcastings and we will ask them, "Is there some truthful person here in this city? So can we have a chance to meet them and talk?" Maybe the day after tomorrow I have some massages.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun and Satto laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Most attractive thing in Chiangmai is the price of massage 120.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Cheap!</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In Bangkok, it's 150 baht. So this is 30 baht cheaper than Bangkok. This is very sad thing&hellip;. But I can't find any other alternative. I always visit so many places with my expectation but when I'm there I always regret 'why I came here?'</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Heheh</p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata indicates to give the message to the director*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So this is&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But one thing is that when I'm helping people I always happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> You're always happy&hellip; heh&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But not sad&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> But not sad</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, not sad, but happy&hellip; welcome people, I welcome you are here&hellip; Don't be sad.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*some laughs and Tathagata replies*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (Laughs while translating for Tathagata):</strong> But if you are in his position, you can't speak like that&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Because I am a sort of follower of the Buddha.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Really</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> We carry on the same message. And being Buddha, as I say that, one quality is loving kindness and compassion - whoever, no exception.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Don't deny until you check the truth of this message.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of course! Of course&hellip;Very very happy to accept or just take some information and try to read it, try to understand, that is the duty of, you know, all Buddhists. But because Buddha said that don't be in very, very position&hellip; I mean&hellip; to believe&ndash; don't jump into belief. If&hellip; If one who is telling that story to you is your teachers. It is on &ndash; don't jump into belief because it is written in the book and don't jump into belief because that story is reasonable by logic. Therefore I am accepting&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You seem to remember one thing. This is right because the human beings speaks lie too easily so don't trust what they speak. But it's not right as well if only deny without checking (without confirmation)&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Of course. What&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> what it is.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> What I am saying is that don't jump into belief 'till you get all information and then try to check by your own practice.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Okay? Same thing. I agree with him.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's impossible for somebody to confirm if they don't know the world. I'm trying so much to make people realize (also now) because you shouldn't be deceived by word and so when you are not deceived you can accept good, you don't accept bad. But you don't know what kind of ordeals do they have when I grow up. Because the destiny of the world put on my shoulder so that's why I cannot give up. Now (at the moment) I work, but after I die, past Buddhas, Jesus, any other Saints or gods (high gods) are nothing compared to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating):</strong> So, his life will remain forever through his teachings.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Today, I came to you and this fact will also be a good teaching for future. Please read that message and after reading, if you want to see me again, then you can find me where I am. We will stay in Chiangmai for two days more, but there is telephone number in England. Then they will know where I am</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Would you like to give it to me?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Or not to me directly&hellip;. Just to put it here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, I gave you</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Just give it to me? &hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ok</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Thank you</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hehe&hellip; because I know one thing that in this country the woman shouldn't give this to the man (monk) directly.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> You see, it is some kind of attachment.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; So that's why I feel it very strange, very pretend to someone</p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*D laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> You see actually in the Buddha teachings, in the rule and regulation, from your heart that is very very important. With sensual pressure, you touch woman, you touch with, even the animal, the male&ndash; female animal &ndash; even then, not only woman. But now, we are friend, yes?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, friends</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Not as sensual, you know, desire, sensual pressure&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Alright&hellip; I see&hellip; hehehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And I think you know the story of Zen Buddhism</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Zen Buddhism?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm, yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> One master carry</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah yes, carry</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> The girl</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The woman&hellip; haha</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Woman, 'cross the river&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; it's a different&hellip; situation&hellip; heh</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Satto laughs*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&hellip;</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Thanks!</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (without Soyun having translated): </strong>There must be ways in teaching so if there's no ways in teaching that teaching is dead. But in your scriptures (your Buddha scriptures) those ways have reappeared. It is not beneficial to people you learned scriptures and teach scriptures. When I met a Muslim lecturer and he asked me, "How many rivers in heaven?"</p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*D laughs continuously for about 15 seconds*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So I told him, "I still don't know how many rivers in my country, then how can I know how many rivers in heaven?"</p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T (laughing):</strong> He said, "But we know because Allah told us how many rivers in heaven, it's written in Quran."&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So I told them, "I don't know what kind of crazy person wrote like that but what is use for people the knowledge of how many rivers in heaven?" So we were in danger because they thought we insulted their religion. It happened in Africa for us.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And then what is&hellip; what do you want people to do in your way?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I hope you _______ live on right way ____________. [Transcription note: Couldn't make out some of this as there is some movement @ 1:19:20]</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And what is that right way?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When you open your eye by yourself to the world, you can understand. In order to get good result, we need good cause. All the bad result comes because they have bad cause. Buddha said the original reason of sin is ignorance. You receive as meditation is good and you are cheated by ghosts. The present world will be disappeared (will be end) 14 years later.*</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> 14 years after this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> That means I'm living&hellip; only up to&hellip; 200&ndash; 2000-something&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> 14 years from now</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> The world will be&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Will be end</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> End&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Disappear</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Uh, let's see, let's see&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In Buddha's words we have the word transmigration. What exists always repeats forever by the activities of 'what is'. This world itself turn round again and again by what happened in it like the hand of this watch, and the time of the world is approaching 12. And this world could exist forever by this kind of periods. The aim of my activities is to save humankind. In spite of all hardships, I continue my traveling. The reason is that the way to save yourself is <em>in</em> yourself (in self). So I am wandering (traveling) round the world to reveal this way. If you are not looking for the way I can't open the way for you. The current religions (all of the religions) act for dead people. And all the universities has same activities to lead this world to the end. So the main bodies that push this human world to the end are universities and religion. So I don't have any method (any ways).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Heh</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Any ways to carry my mission&hellip; May I go to street, with naked,</p>

<p style=""><strong>*someone laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> then people will look at me, 'What happened to the man?' So, I prepare to just go jump into the mass and I show them the evidences about what leads to something wrong and what kind of result will they have from their doing things. I have real one thing that want to tell you. Don't do practice meditation much, don't read Buddha scriptures, and there are many traps to destroy you. So become just a pure general person. The best way to live in this modern society is that just you receive others' situation, understand them, and if you can, help them just as the position of general people. Because at the moment the religion is the dead one that's why if you really want to become a right person then you may lose your position in this. The more important thing than your current position is your own soul. If you really want to save you I'll help you and I can educate you as the most excellent one in this country.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Hehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So, like me, when you open your eye to the world, you become very grand in front of anyone. And even though you don't learn from others, you aren't with old theories, and you will not deceive others. When you make up your mind, I will get contact. Please read that message when I leave here. If you find yourself being interested in the life of Buddhas then please visit me like I visit you. I have been attacked so many from the world of devils. If I had the very common ordinary soul, how I can defeat the army of devils and continue this work? When your soul become brightened, then you will find all the evidences of me. If you can see me with your spiritual eye, then you will find the very shining (very glorious) light from me. But not everyone can see such beauty. You never deny who I am&hellip; in my forehead, we call this <em>sarira</em> as the 'eye of wisdom'. But it never appear among everybody. It can appear from only one being in one world. In spite of all these evidences, if you still deny me then we don't have any point. In case you visit me, bring even one bottle of Coca Cola<strong> *Tathagata laughs*</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> This is a manner to Master</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> To me, I'm not having coca-cola&hellip; because that is the material things people produce and kill many people</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*people begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Because it kills them inside&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs loudly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> It's not natural soda!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (laughing):</strong> Not natural things&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah! He says that,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Even though I'll be killed by the Coca cola that you served, but I'll be still happy that I had treatment from you</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all are laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So&hellip; don't worry about me,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> No&hellip;? &hellip; You know if you love a master,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> you should love them in the way you treat them. Not the thing to kill them&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> No? Never happen like that. Because these American people, you know, Coca Cola, Pepsi, American people produce, and try to, you know? Try to advertise saying that if you take Coca Cola, you are the best, the best, the best!&hellip; you see, that is the world of materialism&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; that's not real&hellip; real demand&hellip;&nbsp; For example, if you come,&nbsp; __________ <strong>*Tathagata is speaking*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We are staying in a hotel, People's Place, it's just opposite Holiday Day</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Chiangmai Holiday&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Villa</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; Maybe you will know Chiangmai Plaza Hotel, it's ____________ <strong>*movement occurs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you have good friends then you can visit me with some questions you really want to know about this world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> But right now I have a question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (laughing): *translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Hehehe&hellip; My question is&hellip; how to open the eye? This is very, very deep question that I know that you don't want to answer this.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> How do you know before you listen?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Because he says&hellip; because he say that he will never tell people till you are ready to&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The secret is very simple. But it may be very difficult to practice. All the creature is born on the basis what happened to them in the past. We call it karma &ndash; what was in the past. But it will very difficult for you to repress your karma by yourself. But it's very simple only when you can suppress them by yourself. Only when you leave (throw away) all your falsehood, then the things will start to be seen to you. From that time, your mind become brightened and the real peace occurs to you. It's the way to make you be Enlightened: when you see 'what is' then from that time you don't speak lie. You only speak people what you've seen. When you begin to see what it is really then your conscience and your courage just produced in your mind. From that time you can devote yourself to awake others. By those efforts, you can make yourself emancipate and you can stand on the way of Buddha. First of all, meet a man of truth, and next you listen and observe what he speak, what he does. Then after about 2 years, then you start to see</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> 2 years</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> to see 'what is' and understand.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> And if I die before that? Hehe&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Only 2 years?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Because you say 14 years to remain&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have ability if you really want to save yourself I can expand your life. Because your soul is the owner of your body so if I give a little of my power to your soul your body never die.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Never die means?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, even though you have a destiny to die, but he can help&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D,S:</strong> to expand</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> To some years&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Without even such ability, how do I wondering all this world? Imagine, because I don't find the way to find people who really want to learn&hellip; wherever, in this temple, by universities&hellip; if I meet anyone then I just say "Shall we make a bet?" I showed those kind of activities because I want to help them to realize. But nobody challenged</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> to my proposal. That's why I couldn't help anybody to realize.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> One more thing that it seem that&hellip; the way to open the eye is to understand what it is&hellip; something like that. And then without concentrate mind, how can one realize or how can one open one, you know, own eye?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> There are waves because of the activities of karma of everybody. So if you can stop the activities of your karma, then it's like just the blind open their eye.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> I don't understand&hellip; how can stop that karma?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> First of all, you need to meet a truthful person and listen, see, and you realize something in the world and you see and awake and realize what it is.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D:</strong> I mean, to&hellip; to stop our karma first, first of all, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hm? Yes?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>And then going to the master&hellip; to the truthful person&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, no, no&hellip; that's not right&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata asks Soyun something in Korean*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The first condition is meeting a truthful master.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>It is to open the eye&hellip; okay? In order to open your eye, you have to go to the truthful person? To meet with&ndash; right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yes, that's right.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>And then? Listening&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Once you open your eye you go by yourself, you are independent. When you are blind, even though a big log in front of you, you can't see that. But when you open your eye, if there's a log you just avoid that and go. When you close your eyes you can't see a river. But when you open your eye, you can see waters (river). Then when you want to cross river, you can find method there. Only when you open your eye you can realize what it is. My teaching is much easier than Shakyamuni Buddha's teaching and very distinctive (very clear).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Without concentrate mind, then how can we open our eye? This still doubt in my mind. Without concentrate mind&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Concentrate the mind <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, it's impossible for you to be Enlightened even though you practice 10,000 years by concentrating. There is a way to arrive the result through questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Through? Through</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Through the questions (problems)</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Through the question</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, through (by)</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Through, yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you don't see by yourself then it will be extremely difficult for you to find out anything by yourself. For example, it's simple farming, but you just sit on forest and concentrate how can I cultivate very nicely, but it's very, very hard to find the way. The best is that you just go farmer and see what farmer does there and learn from him how you cultivate. That's the <em>best</em> way (<em>quickest</em> way). You see what truthful person does and what truthful person speak, this the best way (this is the best learning&hellip; from his action, from his work, speech). When you know something more, then you protect yourself more from making mistakes. But more you don't know, more you are cheated. So when you know more, it's more easier for you to free from the influence of karma.</p>
<p style="">Let's have a very simple example. You start to learn mathematics&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Before you learn, when you see 5 + 5, you can't understand what it is. Because you don't understand the questions that's why you never find what answer that question has. So it's useless you <em>concentrate,</em> concentrate on the question or think over, again and again. But when you learn that, and when you become understand the figures (numbers) then when you see the question you know what is answer. Then when somebody tell you, "Oh, 5 + 5 makes 11" but you don't believe it. Without thinking you just can realize, "No, the answer is 10." You don't need to think about that. Everything is the same ways. So if you really need&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>One&hellip; one more. Heh.&nbsp; One more question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh, ok, last sentence&hellip; In the last sentence he said,</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you really need Enlightenment, and if you truly want to save you, then you probably will bet this position. If you want to save yourself then lots of obstacles will stop you. This young man, Satto, had planned to join this traveling. When he decided that, something happened. His mother and his wife made lots of problems (trouble). And many things happened that ordinary people can't understand. When somebody wants to do something good, there must be many obstacles. That's why you need to discuss with some friends around you and try to confirm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> What is your question?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>The question is, to me, the teachings of the Buddha, one teaching of the Buddha is that he take,&hellip; he's&hellip; you know, this teaching is really, really my concern&hellip; with concentrated mind, okay?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> His teaching?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> (Gautama Buddha's)</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>And one is cultivation of ethical conduct, that's one. And mental discipline is the next one, and insight wisdom is the last one. Okay? And these three, you know, support each other. If you have insight wisdom, that support you to do good things, doing good things support you to have concentrate mind. And he compare the concentrate mind like water. ...</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Like water&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Which is calm&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Okay? Without that&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&hellip;</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Let me explain&hellip; let me explain all. Not the question now. I am just tell what I understand from the teachings of the Buddha, what I learned from the teaching of the Buddha is that meditation or the concentrate mind is really important. Like the water which is calm. Okay? But our mind, if your mind is in trouble, jumping from here and there, here and there, that make us not to go further to the insight wisdom. Similarly, with the water, which is _______ [1:58:00], we see deep inside of such water, we cannot find things. Or even when we can find things inside, it is not really clear. Okay. He compare concentrate mind with calm water. Can you explain something about this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> You say the calm water can reflect?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Not reflect&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Can see</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Can see things inside.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Inside. Things inside.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>And clear things inside</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It doesn't seem Buddha's words&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>It's not the Buddha's words?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Because something that doesn't move going bad. So even water, it doesn't act (move), it become to decay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>But there is something different from what I am explaining. I'm not saying about the water which is dead. But the water which is without wave, is like a mind without disturbance. Mind with <em>concentration</em></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, I know, that's what you understand. ___________________ [Master Tathagata begins speaking, 2:00:00]</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Buddha always emphasized you should confirm anything but you can't see (you can't know) things by only concentrate.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>That's what I'm saying. Concentration means four. Okay? For right understanding. Okay? That is the right&ndash; what I understand. Not we just concentrate. Okay? Not to just concentrate. If just concentrate, it is like Hinduism, like Brahmanism, and like other ascetic before. But after having to some extent you have concentrate mind. Like now, I have a concentrated mind, to try to listen to you, this because of concentration. Therefore I understand what you are saying, or what you are talking about. Without concentration, then how can I understand what you are saying? That's what I mean. &hellip; To some extent I mean.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>I also, you know&hellip; I also against those people who always just concentrate. I also against that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People say the face is the window of mind.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Today I visited the temple that there is&ndash; they teach meditation. But I couldn't find anyone who has a bright face.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Hehe.. yes. I also experience the same.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Someone comes in and speaks with the director for a moment*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> &ndash; they didn't realize the effect. But I could see that among them, inside them, there are the dead souls.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Heh. Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But they have to the same thing for dead souls. But as the result, they will lose their own souls. So I told them, "You have great compassion." because I can't tell them directly. Your mind of compassion (kindliness) is better (much better) than Gautama Buddha's. I've never read that Gautama Buddha gave his body to the poor dead souls in record. That's why you have bigger compassion than Buddha. The master we met already lost his self, so he didn't understand what he talked. I told him, "If I ask you, 'sing west', then you always answer, 'sing east.' Then how can you be helpful to people to realize what do they do (what they are doing)?"&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata, who begins to laugh with Soyun):</strong> When he spoke this, here is a monk who guided us to the car. From here we started. So, he was very upset and he said that, "I'm going!" but we didn't have any car, so that's why we had to follow him, "Please, let's go too!" Hahah.. So we arrive here again, you know&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Everybody has very weak will. That's why they are badly used by dead spirits. You are very smart but you made lots of mistake. Because you already have your spiritual guide in you but you can maintain this circumstance because you are not a person with weak will. So I tell you the way of praying. When you pray by yourself, without persons, you pray like this. You don't need to call Buddha or Bodhisattvas. You have to pray to your guidance, "I am not sinner, I don't have much sin, so please let me go, let me be free." Otherwise you will be under of the influence of that guidance. How can I know the secrets that you even don't know much? During our conversation, I felt something blocked here.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Where, here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Within myself &ndash; in me? Right here</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Mm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I can perceive immediately it was not your own energy</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If I don't perceive even such thing, then I'm always in trouble during my traveling. In this world there is only one being that the dead souls can't invade carelessly. It move _______ [2:11:09], then I can just pursue where it is. It will influence to you in the future a little. Wrong teachings all cause this kind of damage. You don't need to practice meditation and read Buddha scriptures. I tell you one secret of Buddha scriptures&hellip; When you read something if they don't have any questions then they are not useful. All the ways to attain the result stay in questions. Any contents doesn't have the questions then we can see there is no way to the result. In Buddha scriptures, it is read as "You should live good" but there's no way how we can live good. So it's useless however they repeat and again 100 times "you should live good". There are lots of traps in such words. If somebody try to make them realize by reading books then they will waste their whole life. And the present Buddhism is the dead one. Some people say they can be Enlightened through practicing meditation but it means that sometimes the ghost enter them and they make the one can see something behind wall. Ignorant people think, "oh, their mind has very high enlightenment because he can see and we can't see" but the ghost can perceive that. So they are just deceived by ghosts. Enlightenment means they become master to the world. They can perceive the questions (the problems) about how this world exists and what are in the questions. They perceive such things. All the cause of all the answers is the questions. How can I expand your life? How can I give you Enlightenment? This is very simple. I just realize what problems you have and I just change the problems that you have. When problems change, the answers change as well. The difference of me between others is that to perceive these things. So don't deny my words&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Yeah&hellip; but to me, one thing that come to me is that, when Buddha explained his Enlightenment, you say that it is difficult to do and this is impossible in this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>In this world now, in this present world</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Okay?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Right? No?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, the best thing now is to make people realize and guide them to good way (right way). Awakening people, this is the best one. Even though you wish to help people awaken, but if you can't see the world, if you don't understand the world, you can't do that.&nbsp; So if you really want to know something among possible things then you should go the person who know that. If you want to do computer then you should go to person who know more than you. If you want to learn how to be a driver you should learn from the person can drive. We can learn nothing just by sitting. This is just make self be cheated. When you listen something that you don't know, that you don't understand, then you should demand them to show the evidences.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>One is not&hellip; regarding this&hellip; What I am trying to, you know, to explain and get maybe, you know, the answer is that, he said that, the teachings of the Shakyamuni Buddha is now, you know, no more&ndash; is the dead teachings</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Dead</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mhm, yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Which cannot be practiced</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Like that&hellip; but to me, what I have learned, when Buddha teach about doing good, he explained many things prior to that. He explained that if you are a good &ndash; if you are, you know, practice as a Buddhist, even you are a seller, you are a traitor, you should avoid selling out.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>You should avoid selling poison&hellip; You should avoid selling human beings. Avoid selling meat. Many things. And you should observe five precepts. Abstaining from killing, from stealing, from telling lie, from taking intoxicating drink, and many things, you know, are being explained after that. So then how come you say that this is now the dead teachings?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Dead teachings&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*translates*&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, Buddha is not ignorant like you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People do bad because of their karma.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Can they change that karma? Or they cannot change?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yes! Buddha gave 5 basic precepts but it's very difficult for ordinary people to keep them because everybody has their different karma so this is because of the influence of karma it's very hard for them to keep that. Everybody has their own different karma so how can people become good one because somebody say, "You should do good." If somebody says, "You shouldn't do good" but how can good people become changed bad because of that words? It is true that when religion started, they gave precepts. We can make only two gist of Buddha's teaching. One is theory of transmigration. He explained how this world become into being by what kind of principle. And he revealed about the law of cause and effect. He told (he informed) where is the origin that make things better or worse. If it is really living Buddhism, then it must make people to realize of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>That means no one realize</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, no one realize that Buddhism is dead</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Nobody who is now alive the one who realize</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The one who realize</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> My duty is not one of Buddha's. I didn't come here as a Buddha, I came to the world as a savior.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Not a Buddha?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> His role is not just the Buddha's. He came here as a Messiah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> He was forced to come into human world, not by his will. (He was not willing to come here in this age.)</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He was forced to come here.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Forced by?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He was forced coming into human world</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>By whom?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> By whom? <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I applied by myself, I volunteered to come to this world</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>You say forced?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Yeah, he explain now</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> By this situation</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Huh?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> By the situation</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>By the situation</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I told you I was the Buddha in Paradise, it means that I was a teacher all the gods.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In Paradise, there was a conference to decide something but it was the meeting of some higher gods, but they can't demand the main Buddha to attend there or not. What I'm talking now is in my message (pamphlet). I saw that nobody volunteered to come into the world to save mankind. That's why I had to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>But many people, to me, many people said, "I am coming to this world by&ndash; in order also to save the world" like prophet Mohammad, like Jesus Christ, and like Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h. And they also claimed the same thing.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*upon receiving translation, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But Jesus was the same level of Bodhisattva. But Mohammad, he gave his body God (he received some spirit). If they came to save this world, they should leave some teachings how they could save this world. But I've never seen any teachings from them through their lives.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>In Bible?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In Bible</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>In Quran?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> In Quran&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In Quran, in Bible, there are no matters (no problems) there. All of those scriptures were written by some people who had ghosts. That's why those books leave so much damage to people's world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>And also include the Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Who is Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>You don't know Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h? Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; teaching.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh, Bah&aacute;'&iacute;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is the name of&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> God</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>the prophet</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The prophet, yeah&hellip; ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>That came to the earth and claimed that I am&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Bah&aacute;'&iacute;&nbsp; <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>also, yes&hellip; And to serve and the world savior&hellip; I am now coming to the world to save the world</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've visited Bah&aacute;'&iacute; house in England. Because we didn't find any place to visit there, so we had to go there. When I saw what they did, it was so ridiculous. In order to awake them, I made play with them. At that time, a man who charged that house came to us. He drove away the people around&hellip; He invited us to come to his house and he invited some friends and his family there. And he asked to me things about the world. And he just request me to bless them with my hand. He didn't talk anything else. I've also met the popes, sankaracharyas of Hinduism, but sankaracharyas, they also ran away when we talked.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Hehehe&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I met many great gurus in India, but there's one who kneeled to me. He was the best looking and he spoke so fluently. It is impossible if I want or not the main Buddha. It will be mistake if you see me in the same level of Jesus or Shakyamuni Buddha.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>But now you see even Bush, the president Bush, he's also saying that he came also that, he will save this world&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (laughs): *translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Right? Because he is now ruling the world&hellip; trying to control the world&hellip;. Then what is his idea about this? Does he claim that he can save the world?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, Bush doesn't have intention to rule this world. He is the president of America. As the president, he pursues their own profit. But I can say if he is right or not only when we talk on the certain problems. But he is in very difficulties because he invaded (he attacked) Iraq without understand Iraq. The thing in the world exists in the problems. So we can make bad world change into good world, on contrary, good world also can be changed into bad world by problems. When I see this world, the world is perfect. I don't have anybody to compete to me with all parts of things in the world like politics, economics, religion, philosophy, medicine, besides Buddhism. For this work we don't have special donors. I have to prepare all the expenses for this work in right way. When I attend some people to help me like translator or&hellip; then I have to pay all of them. And I've never received any money from others in unright way. When I need money I do work like many other people. When I work, then people are very frightened (surprised). I could solve everything to _______ [@2:39:45] way even though I never experienced such kind of things, because I am very well trained. When I came to the world, I had unspeakable ordeals. When we come to travel, Satto&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> His name is Satto</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Satto had question why the Enlightened Master like woman very much?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Because we always smile at women!</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It passed 20 years since I obtained my Enlightenment.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Years?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But most of people (almost all of the people) run away from me (looked away). But, those girls smiled at me and they call me, "Come!" So now I am quite&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> What's that&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Well</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> "I have another vitality", you know?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> To survive</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Where are those girls?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Those girls? Those girls&hellip; massage girls&hellip; hehe&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Well it is very different from the Sakyamuni Buddha&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Very different? <strong>*laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Because he himself, after getting Enlightenment, only one, only two months after, only seven weeks&hellip; two months he preached to five monks and they follow his footstep&hellip; and after that, just only 9 months, the number of his follower are 1,250. They gathered and tried to plan how to work and how to spread this message to the public and to let them understand and to let them&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> You mean the five months later?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Nine months later!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Nine months later&hellip; 1,250?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Followers</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh&hellip;<strong> *translates and someone laughs quietly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D:&nbsp;</strong> But in 20 years many people run away&hellip;!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So that's why he says that's just opposite way!</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> After 2 months since my Enlightenment, I lost my friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And after 9 months later all my relatives stopped to visit me! So I didn't find anyone to talk, that's why I killed all my times as a drunk [Transcription note: This needs to be confirmed by the original Korean words.]. Where I visit, I had cold receptions. When I wake up in the morning, I didn't have any place to go. So I started to travel abroad, left my country that I can communicate. I have been trying very hard for 20 years, and now I have only about 10 people. And they don't follow me because of my teaching but follow me because of my abilities. But the people who follow me, among them, nobody died in 20 years, and their livings become very good. The Buddha that you mentioned stands just on the opposite way of me. <strong>*laughing*</strong> But I don't want to believe in what you said before. But when we see in record, Gautama Buddha died at Kushinagar. He died on the street during traveling. He traveled to find people. If he had so many followers with 9 months (already 1,250), then why he had to live alone? (very lonely)</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>How come you say alone? because the record say that there are many</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, lonely</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Monks</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Not alone&ndash; lonely&ndash; in loneliness</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>The record&hellip; you know, about his attendants, about his many of great followers, around when he died&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In my message, there is one secret that you didn't know. When I opened my eye, I had a message from the very, very remote space. And the message carried to me with great ecstasy in my body. In those messages, here is one sentence. 'If someone knows the truth, he will be lonely; if someone tells truth, he will be cursed.' I know if I reveal the truth, all the human being will abandon me (they discard) but I don't give up revealing the truth because the way to save themselves are in the truth. Every day, in spite of cold reception from human being, I visit them, I try to tell them the truth. So sometimes, when I see myself, I'm very lonely. But, sometimes, I feel myself very proud. So today, we also tried to meet some people, but still we didn't have lunch. I'm okay, I am old, but he is very young, he must be very hungry <strong>*Tathagata laughing*</strong> If you have some question or doubt about me, then whenever you visit me then you check. If what I speak reveal as a falsehood, then I'll take all the responsibilities of my words. You probably have lots of friends in this city&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No?</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Many friends&hellip; they are indeed, to me, really very good&hellip; They are very kind to me&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Any of Buddha call themselves as a Tathagata, not Buddha. If you want to see the living Tathagata, you have time of 2 days. Only he knows all the teachings of all the Buddhas and only he can find where is the way to achieve our wishes. So after reading that messages, and you have telephone there, so you will find where we are. I can give answers as long as you give questions to me. And I can tell you how you can understand such questions. You should know what you want to know first. If I don't tell you so that you understand what you want to know, no matter how many things I speak, it's useless. You can't compare to money when you become to know something that you didn't know. You will feel something when you read that message. If you don't have anything feeling then our relations will finish. People will know where the Chiangmai Holiday</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> You have the card? I can copy there the telephone</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People will tell you where the Chiangmai Holiday Hotel is. We are staying in &hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> People's Lodge</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> People's Place Lodge</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> People's Place is a hotel&hellip; People's Place hotel</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You can meet us there. If you can meet the next world then it will be the most honorable moment that you met me today in your life. Anybody who visits me must be ready to be broken. But if they make mind that they are not broken by me, then it's impossible to become friends. In the world of human beings, in the world of gods, there's no one who can argue with me about the truth. You can trust this one thing. Otherwise nobody can speak like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating):</strong> When we visit some place, if they show cold attitude, then he always says, "If you can answer to my questions, then I'll give my life."&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> For 20 years, I always gave so big talk. But still my neck is&hellip; <strong>*laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I hope your good life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Thank you&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*movement and some conversation occurs, and a few moments later Satto takes a picture of the director with Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> I will&hellip; with flash, it's better&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>*one more photo is taken*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Okay&hellip; thank you</p>

<p style=""><strong>&hellip;</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If somebody is looking for Buddha, please contact.&nbsp;</p>


<p style="">* Recorded between Dec 18 and 20, 2004.</p>
