<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> We came to Thailand to contact living Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Buddhist monk, Doctor:</strong> Living Buddhism?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (translator for Tathagata):</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>However, we haven't yet contacted that living Buddhism in this country. Before leaving Thailand, we came to Chiang Mai as last time. I hope to find the living Buddhism through you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Monk and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I still don't know if Thailand Buddhism is for living people or for the dead.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Monk begins to laugh quietly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> (For whom)</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Could you answer?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B:</strong> Um&hellip; I think the situation of Buddhism in Thailand right now is for the people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> For the people</p>

<p style=""><strong>B:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Living people</p>

<p style=""><strong>B:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Then could you tell me the proof that you said before? (You said the Thailand Buddhism is for the living people, then could you tell me the proof of your claim?)</p>

<p style=""><strong>B:</strong> Still people&hellip; come to monastery, study Buddhism, but not as a whole, okay? Practice meditation, there are many, many meditation center which is going on running and quite popular, you see, and it's evidence&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; that's your evidence.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>In the village, in each village, there's one temple and it's the center for the religion. Whatever functions, ceremonies, some people are close to the monks, to monastery&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If somebody say this is the living Buddhism, then they should have the ways in their teachings. For one month, I have been looking very hard in this country to find the Buddhism with the ways, but I failed to find anyone who knows. And now, I am very surprised to listen to you. Do you mind if I speak to you my truth (the fact)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>No I don't mind.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>People teach meditation and people learn meditation. Then what is the reason of the activities? Is the reason of compassion or the reason of ignorance?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Meditation?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, meditation. Why do you learn or teach meditation? Because people are ignorant or people are so generous? What is the reason: compassion, or ignorance?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>It should be a right thing&hellip; to learn meditations. We, you know, actually we develop only science. We develop very high in science and technologies. People forget to develop their mind &ndash; themselves. So in our society these days, as we evidence, it's imbalanced. People rich, at once, in science and technology, we develop, we live in comfort with the basic needs, but some people not happy, right? Many people having mental problems, many people live in the state of fear, worry. Depressive pill, maybe sleeping pill follow for these people because imbalance developing. So meditation, it make them to understand themselves too. Not for compassion only, but to understand themselves. To live &ndash; to know how to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>To know</p>

<p style=""><strong>S, B: </strong>how to live</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>happily</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>happily</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Not&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Because, she has to translate many&hellip; if it's too long&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Ah&hellip; too long&hellip; hehe..</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates for Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If you try for meditation because of compassion then your compassion is much higher than the Buddha's (Gautama Buddha's). But if you learn or teach meditation because of ignorance, then this is really miserable thing. I have wondering always and doubt when I see the people who practice meditation. When people practice meditation, they find themselves become peaceful. The reason is that in the process of practicing meditation, the dead people's soul can enter to their bodies. In this case, they feel they become very peaceful. The creature can be divided into two kinds. One is body and the other one is a soul. If we compare to some material, the body is like a car, and our soul controls our body and they make their own activities through our body. So, if the others' soul (the dead soul) come into our body, it means that we have two drivers in one body. If the invader&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It means another person's soul</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>push away original soul and it take the handle, then in this case, own body (original body) don't conscious anything. (Even though they're hungry, they don't feel much hunger. They don't feel tired.) It means that they don't have peace from meditation. On contrary, they lost themselves. In some case, there are many other souls can invade. In this case we can see many kinds of activities (behavior), many different natures, from the one person because there are multiple souls inside. Then it is so unhappy thing for a person, and meditation is the best way to call the dead soul into one's body, and the dead people always try to attack the living people. So this is for the dead, not for living people.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>This means meditation, he said</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Once when you contact the dead soul or let them come inside, nobody can expel them again easily. So, in my point of view, this is very dangerous. (Meditating is very dangerous.) That's why I always questioned why do they practice meditation as this is so dangerous, because of your ignorance, or because of your compassion? Today we visited a TV station (Chiang Mai TV station) and asked the director introduced, "If we meet you, may we can have right answer from you." In Bangkok, when I stayed there, I proposed this idea&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I proposed this idea in front of many monks and many journalists: If there is one person in Thailand who understands the real Buddha's teaching, know even one thing of Buddha's teaching, then I would like to donate 10 million baht for them. I would like to spend this money in Chiang Mai city.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> Do you think, is it possible in Chiang Mai?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*All begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>This is not a matter of money. This is very, very important thing for numerous living people. This is the only opportunity that you can check what have you learned so far and what you have teaching (taught and are now teaching) for people. (You can check the truth of this.) So, it's very simple for me to verify that's Buddha's teaching, that's not Buddha's teaching when I listen. Because Gautama Buddha always told like this, the cause makes result. (Cause produce effect.)</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Oh, cause.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Cause, yeah?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Buddha told like this. It means that there was a way (there was the ways) in his teaching. So when we speak about the truth, or speak truth, then we should show what are in the result by problems. So I have been wondering indeed, who can show that to me?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Show?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Show that. *Soyun confirms with Tathagata*</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Show Buddha's teaching ('that' Buddha's teaching) to me</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Some begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Thailand has much more monks (number) than any other countries. So it will be very miserable thing if so many men become monk only for giving their body to dead people and sacrifice themselves.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (explaining):</strong> If their purpose is like this, it is misery for them.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Even if our soul stay in ourselves, but if those souls don't act (can't act) then they become useless. So I am very frightened because you believe that the practice is good and you also want to spread them to ordinary people, society. But if you really want to spread this, you should tell others what is the result, what can happen in the process of meditation. Then they will decide. (They listen all the result and they will decide.) So you just give them the opportunity to decide whether they will practice or not. (And the full realization&hellip; the truth of this) I don't make any comment about their decision. If they want that, 'oh, I sacrifice my body to the dead soul', that's okay, because that's their freedom. But it's not right for some people who deceive others like this, 'if you practice this then you will get healthy or you can have peace'&hellip; If people cheat like that, this is not right. When people learn living teaching, they just can understand when they learn one day. (They understand whatever they learn in case they learn living teaching.) But, people will ignorant if they learn dead teaching. (If we go 100 years, they are in the same state of unknowing.) The result when they learn dead teaching is that if somebody has very intelligent and healthy consciousness, he will recognize he has been cheated for whole life. So, if you do very well, finally you will learn one thing. Finally you will find that 'even though I have been trying to learn for all my life, I couldn't know any one thing'. I would like to have a bet with Buddhist scholars, teachers, and Buddhists in this city in Thailand, about Buddha's teaching. I would like to use your Buddha scriptures and we would like to have an opportunity to confirm through the question and answers. And the condition of this game is that I am only person, so&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> He will give 100 questions to you,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>and your team, we don't know how many people you will have (the scholars monks or ordinary Buddhists&hellip;), you will give 100 questions to me. If I don't realize (don't understand) what are in those questions, if 1 question&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> You gave him 100 questions but if he's wrong in only 1 question among 100 questions, then he will be a loser. Or, if you can know even 1 answer of his 100 questions,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then I'm also loser.&nbsp; (If you find only 1 answer.) I like perfection. So if I lose in this game, I will donate 10 million baht. If I bet 10 million baht, then you also must bet a little money (I don't want much). At least 1,000 baht.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So he will bet 10 million, you will bet 1,000 only&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>In fact, if I win, but that money is not enough for our hotel rooms.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*All begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But, it will make a very good motivation to happen to you (good thing). I'm staying in Chiang Mai three days more. So, please help me, and please give me some opportunity to meet good teachers in this city. And if you really try for this, then you will learn much more things within three days than through all your life. If you learn from somebody who doesn't know, then you will not know even though you learn for 100 years, you are in the same state of ignorance. But if you learn from somebody who knows, then even though you learn a moment, but you know. You will realize this simple truth.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a brief side conversation takes place*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I hope that there will be much good things in your future, and I came here to see you because I want you'll be a person who saved Thailand Buddhism. In case you can make up your mind with your friends (maybe, people around you), to revive the lost Buddhism, then I want to help you. I will awake your sleeping soul and I'll let the dead souls away from you who have been cheating you for a long time. You can't attain anything (you can't accomplish anything) with the dead souls inside. But I admit that you live in peace. Because if you work that the dead souls enter the ordinary people's body, then ordinary people will support your living. You have your own appearance but nobody knows your actions come from your own soul or the others. The result is that you will give a very dreadful result to the world. So this is not simply the matter of compassion. These days, there are numerous dead souls who are trying and want to stay with the living people because they led their livings in wrong way when they alived, and we should solve these problems by right teachings. It's very difficult without your effort and your sacrifice to make this world good. So, from now on, if you have some questions or you want to know, then let me know. I told you before I will answer all the questions from the excellent scholars, then you can test me right now, how can I speak like that. And if you have some questions in the sutras, or any other books you've read or learned, then right now, you can ask me if you wanted to get answer.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If you trust me, you can know the things that other people never could understand with their own lives. Otherwise, maybe we can go together, to the forest to meet the forest monks&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Forest monks?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>&hellip; and what kind of practice do they have and what is the result of their practice, we can have opportunity to check. I will show you no one, you may believe that they know something of Buddha's teaching, know anything of Buddha's teaching. When you confirm this fact your action can be different. Of course, in your position, my words is the last thing that you want to believe. But when you have chance to check and confirm you may can be different. It is impossible to compete to me with the power of the dead souls and the gods, ghosts. So it is impossible for them with their power to deceive me. You will be able to see the true color (true nature) of them with me (beside me). So&hellip; could you recommend one name in Chiang Mai who is the best teacher?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>The best knowledgable monk</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Best knowledge&hellip; There are many. Um&hellip; There's one close to here. He's master of meditation.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (laughing quietly):</strong> Master of meditation&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Mhm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Shall we go to him together? You may see some evidence he may lost himself already and he could show very strange behavior in front of us. I can see what his soul is like (how his soul changed) only when I meet him, I can see that. So the best way to learn is to confirm. When we check everything can be revealed &ndash; is meditation really good for ordinary people, or not. When people practice meditation, there's something wrong happens, then the dead soul possess the living person, then the living person show the activities from the dead soul. From that time, the dead souls try to tell others that meditation is the best way for you because they want another dead souls that enter the body. And the result is that it becomes spread like infectious disease. In this case, without any check (confirmation) of the fact, then this becomes very popular and the population become increase very rapidly. You act now very reasonably, but if we have chance to have interview with the monk that you recommended then he will show us a very unstable attitude.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Would you like to go to see that master - to meet him?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes after Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Let's go together.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> It's far from here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Ah&hellip; 3 kilometers maybe.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>3 kilometers&hellip; not so far. That's near&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>The important thing is that many people has great expectation upon you. So you are important one. So you need to see the fact and you need to realize the truth. And this chance cannot be given easily. If you don't see by yourself, with your own eyes, you will not believe&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>maybe he go but however he report to you what happened, but if you don't believe that, you don't believe it&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>In this world, we hardly have good people because there was no good teachings. If you wish I can help you to open your eyes to what happened in the world. There's no more virtue than you teach what you saw and know. (So if you teach what you know from your own observation, then that's the best virtue.) But, you can make mistakes when you try to teach something without knowing. Please let me know if you found something that you can't agree with me. Then I show the evidence of my words and we'll go together. If there's no proof how we trust something? I can see what is in the truth but you cannot see. In this case, without clear evidence, how we can trust? That's why the proof is most important when you explain something what is between us. When you check by yourself the result of the long time of practicing meditation, then you can teach people around you. You shouldn't try much to give your body to others' soul with compassion. Buddha left the path (ways) in his teaching. But eventually, the dead souls interfere religions. Because they interfere (have been interring a long time in religion), that's why we lost the ways. So I can tell you if you read Buddhist sutras more and more, harder and harder, then it will cause more damage. Buddha's teaching are not stay in Buddha's scriptures only. We can see Buddha's teaching in <em>everything</em> in this world. So I can teach people how they can see those things in the world. Because I don't know your purpose to became a monk I can't tell you all my truth before you tell me your truth. (What is your aim to became monk or stay as a monk?) No matter how hard you try to teach something for people but the fact is that you don't know. So the result is not virtue but sin. Even though you want to learn this world, but you don't have any teacher who can tell you. So that's also in vain&hellip;. I'm staying in Chiang Mai for three days, so try to learn the world, to see the world. Then you will be the best monk in Thailand in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Where are you staying?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>We are staying in a hotel, People's Place, it's just opposite of Chiang Mai Holiday.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Holiday villa.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Chiang Mai Holiday hotel is very new but we are staying in a small hotel&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Monk and Soyun laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I can donate 10 million baht for good thing but I am very, very stingy for myself. So I sleep in the room of 450 baht&hellip; *Soyun laughs* a night&hellip;. This is my nature (my true nature) to show for people. My nature is that so stingy for myself but generous for others.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Buddhist monk speaks to someone in Thai*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Are you visiting here for three days?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, three days here&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When we know what life is, life is so precious because there is a way in life. The way which you will survive or not in the future stays in life, and the decision you will be a Buddha or a devil stays in the way in life. So what I'm so anxious is that you don't see these ways. Because when we tried in Bangkok, some people said, 'Yeah, in Thailand, there are many monks who know Buddha's teaching' so we spent several tens of thousand baht in this country now.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Mm&hellip;. What is the real meaning of Buddha's teachings?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When I say Buddha's teaching, it means teaching for the living people and the living teaching can awake people's ignorance. But modern universities and religion, they don't do this thing properly. That's why the human societies are in very dangerous crises. Otherwise, why a person like me appear in this world? This world left a very short lifetime. If you decide to go to the Buddha's way even though it is very difficult, then I can do for you first to save your life. But if you stay in this situation continuously, then your soul will meet the end. The only way to avoid the end stays in the truth, and we should see the way in the truth through only problems. But it's impossible for you with your abilities now to see them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>I will check to that monastery whether the master is there or not. If he's there, we'll move&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>To that monastery.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>That's a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>How many years have you been monk?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>I have been monk for 2 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>2 years</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Don't think life carelessly. Life is not such easy thing. You should check always what you're doing. There's no teacher who can teach you among monks. So, you'd better to check this fact with me using this opportunity. If we go to meditation master, then I tell him what is the problem with meditation. Then he will say, "No, you are wrong. Meditation is good." Then he must show the evidence of his claim. It's very dangerous for people if they can't show the evidences of their claim (they teach that).</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>I want to ask a question&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>You mentioned about meditation.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>But you think that it's dangerous ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>I don't know what kind of meditation that's dangerous. Please comment&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You've already infectious&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Did you understand what I mean? &hellip; "You have already infectious" Ah, it means that there is an infectious disease spreading but you also have infection. "You are infected."</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>It's very easy for dead soul can invade (enter) to your body through you practicing meditation. In this case, there are two drivers in one car. So, two souls try to control your body. According to the cases, if the invader (the others' soul) don't make your own soul act then your own soul will become die because of lacking of energy of activity. Everything in this world can bear fruit from their activities (what happened in their activities). When they stop to act, it's impossible to bear fruit. As the result, one's own soul will die because they don't act.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>If we stop acting, nothing moving, right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; nothing moving</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>&hellip;or what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Have you seen water&hellip; it doesn't move&hellip; water doesn't move, then they decay?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>There is a hole, water, no flow, it doesn't move,</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Water?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Then they go bad. Have you seen that? This is just a phenomenon when water doesn't move, it just becomes too bad.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Everything in the world is fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Ah&hellip; we wait for car,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>How did you come here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Ah, we came here by taxi</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> By taxi&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Ah, taxi. So&hellip; car has gone out, maybe another few minutes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Good, excellent&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Do you want, I'll get you coffee, &hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> Coffee !</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes, please.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Maybe a few minutes, and I'll come back. I have a meeting with a monk, he may accompany us&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> But stay with us&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Yes, I'll stay here, back with your coffee&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Good&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He'll come too?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah he will come back. He'll attend a meeting&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; yeah?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Buddhist monk 2:</strong> So how long have you studied Buddhism?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I've studied in this life. I just see them. That's why among my words, there's no untruth. But I know one thing. The abilities of the gods can't compete to me.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> The gods?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, gods. No competition with me.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Oh&hellip; he doesn't believe in&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He mistakes god with&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>No, there are many high level of gods, but&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> their wisdom can't be compared (compete) to him.&nbsp; No competition with&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> He means&hellip; uses his theory to prove truth by himself</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Without the ability of gods?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>No&hellip; he just opened his eyes, just see the truth, and tell what he sees. So he never studied from books &ndash; he never read any other books.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Then&hellip; where does the knowledge come from? From his experience?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>How can somebody see everything in the world through their own experience?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Ah&hellip; what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>How can someone see <em>everything</em> in the world through their own experience? Because you asked him "from experience?"&nbsp; So he answered like that. With experience, nobody can explain everything in this world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Because I am not so rich, so I bet only 10 million baht, if I am rich man, then I could bet 1 million million baht. You know, if I make one mistake, one word, then it means I lose 10 million baht. But it's not easy to take my money.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Satto, Soyun, the monk, and Tathagata laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>So, I came to Thailand and I challenge the game, this is you know, one of ten thousand times.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Somebody arrives with drinks*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Would you give me a glass of water?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> A glass of water? Okay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>It was really interesting&hellip; We visited Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University in Bangkok, same branch&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Yes, it is the campus&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, campus</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>And we saw a western man gave a lecture to many monks. He made speech about Dharma. So after his lecture, then we talked to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*side conversation takes place*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>"You spoke very fluently to the lecturers&hellip;" So he said "I was very impressed by what you told. I'm just wondering did you talk what you know or you don't know? (Did you talk what you know or did you talk what you don't know?)"&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> He talk a lot&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monk and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:&nbsp;</strong> So, you is not you &ndash; the lecturer.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> The lecturer, the western lecturer,</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Oh, he asked him that,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, he is speaking about story (what happened). So&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>"To check about that, if you spoke to people what you know, or don't know, so I'd like to ask you 100 questions from your book. If you can answer one question, then you are winner. "</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> Glass of water&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Thank you very much</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>"If you cannot verify through your answer that you know one thing then you will be a loser." So, I bet 10 million baht for this game, and he (the western man) asked me, "Why are you trying to lose?"&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monk laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>So I answered, "If you can beat me, I'll be very happy. This is a game (bet), so I bet 10 million, you bet 1000, okay?" So, on the conversation, a monk came, and he took the western man. So, I lost only one opportunity to make money of 1000 baht. *Soyun laughs* Thailand people maybe don't like gambling, so I can't find anyone to lose 1000 baht for me. Aren't you wondering how I can make this big talk? In mathematics, if somebody don't know figure 1, then they don't know 100. When I see the book, I can find this is from somebody who knows or somebody who doesn't know. So no matter how he may insist (claim) that, "I know", but if I demand the evidences (the proof) of his knowledge, then everybody will be defeated. You may have some opportunities to listen the visitor lecturer and so what you've learned are all the word &ndash; they put their own word together. That's why actually your knowledge, you don't have much knowledge that can be helpful to people actually&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; did you have some questions? When you study?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> When you study?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm, when you study Buddhism, then do you have some questions that you cannot have answer?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Um&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Some doubts&hellip; or questions&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> In Buddhism?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> What you learned, yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>In Buddhism, in life, or about yourself&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Something you don't understand&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> I just learn and practice and I don't think anything easily without proving. I just practice according to the Buddha eventually but I never looking down on others' knowledge. I always honor other things. I am aware of the moment, to learn, but you talking about belief, or you follow honors, he should want make this issue to follow&hellip; but however, when we stay in the world, when I am living, I try to use my bad action and try to cultivate good things.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Okay&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Not only for me for others</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You have very noble idea but your dream cannot come true easily. It is possible for you, what you just wanted, when you make yourself realize after right learning. But I am concerned about you because you don't have any teacher to make you realize around you. You think you learn but the content you learn everyday is just listening to something that is made by people. But those teachings doesn't make your soul brighten. Instead, it makes your soul go to a more dark place. This age is very dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Dangerous</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Dangerous</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Dangerous&hellip; this age</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Dangerous</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Dangerous, yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If we make a little mistake, we are entrapped (fall into a trap). So it's not good for people to practice meditation carelessly as they want to have peace. Such play is a very dangerous gambling. (It will cause great danger.)&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Um&hellip;. Personally, I think that meditation is nothing &ndash; is the way to calm down the mind because in Buddhism, we believe that every human's actions started from the mind first. Life consists of two parts. Mind and body. The mind is the master: whatever he thinks from the mind first&hellip; So the body is just a slave of the mind. The body just follow from the nature. One day when you die, you have to return the body to the nature. You have only the mind&hellip; good or bad according to your action, right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Okay, let's listen to the master about what you said.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>He is different, he says,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I don't have thinking. I don't think,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>He is perfectly truthful person and he only conscious of things, he doesn't use his mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I explained before about meditation continuously, and we are going to meditation master to check this.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You can get calmness in mind or peaceful because you don't know how the result (situation) happen . That's why you just have belief that meditation is very good for people &ndash; because you don't know the process how people have calmness in mind. When others' soul enter to our body, it's very easy they can make such kind of phenomena. You may want to deny this fact&hellip;. but that's not right for you to deny without any confirmation. If you listen to others very easily, then you also may accept some others' soul. I've already perceived a certain power that is moving in your inside. At the moment, I can't tell you what kind of influence it will give you. But I will be able to tell you when we have more time to contact and how the activities of that soul influence to you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> He's from Japan&hellip; right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; he is not Japanese. He was born in Korea, South Korea, but we came from England.&nbsp; Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Mm&hellip; What is the purpose to meet&hellip; Just travel around?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>No we came to Thailand to contact the real Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> I see&hellip; You can contact Buddhism but if you don't practice, you're not the truth at all. You just contact&hellip; like he say, just learn from effects, just learn from the person, but you don't practice&hellip; Find some opportunities to practice and you'll realize the truth. The reason religion is practical is not by coming into contact, it's not by this&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>We don't know when you say practice what do you mean by that? If you want to know the truth, then you need to meet a teacher who knows that. That's the best way to learn if you want truth. Otherwise, this is just the matter of hope &ndash; it can't come true. The Buddhist monks have been cheating people for a long, long time by those words. And there are so many monks who spend their lives in vain because they are cheated by those instructions. I am very anxious of them, not because they just spend their lives in vain, but because so many people live without realization themselves (they forgetting themselves) because they are controlled by the dead souls. Buddha devoted himself for living people, not for the dead. It's true if we awake the living people, then we don't have the very miserable souls.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It means that when they live rightly, when they stay in the living situation, but they don't become miserable ghosts.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>According to Buddha's teaching, this world is not decided by people's hope, but all the results will come by the causes of what happens in everything. He only revealed this truth.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata says something in Korean*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Car&hellip; How is the car ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> It's coming&hellip; hehe. We have only two cars&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Car is coming?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Cause a car went, has to come back&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> Hm? No car?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> No car&hellip; yet.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Are you hurried to go somewhere?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>ah, no, not so hurried, but&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata says something and Soyun laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>He says,</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Just the master can speak English?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Uh&hellip;. I'm not sure if the master can speak English, but we can have a translator translating him&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm, he can translate.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Go to the doctor, and let's go now. We can take a taxi.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B2:</strong> Taxi?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S, Satto:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> We can</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>We will pay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>We will pay, no problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>We don't know when car will return&hellip;</p>

<hr />
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>The meeting with master of meditation in Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter): </strong>Hello</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> Hello, good morning. How are you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> You can sit on floor.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Uh, yes..?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Maybe he will prefer to sit on a chair.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Should I sit here, or</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>can he sit in a chair?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*movement occurs and some time passes*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He will sit here, I think</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>You sit here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Okay&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*more movement occurs as people get seated*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Today I visit you because I have one question that I cannot have answer. I came to Thailand and I've met many of monks here, and they told me meditation is the best teaching of them. So I have lots of things to understand about this.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a monk begins to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When I was very anxious about this subject, that young man asked me, "Because the monks are ignorant, that's why they practice meditation. Is this right?" So I answered him, "No, you're not right. Probably monks practice meditation because they have great compassion." So, we came here to understand what is right of two claims. And he asked me, "What happens with us when we practice meditation?" "Everybody has different nature of organs."</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> &hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Organs&hellip; according to individual condition&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>"But the common thing is that they have same result." And he asked me again, "What is the common result that happens to everybody?" I answered, "When people practice meditation, they receive the dead soul (the soul of the dead people) inside and when this happens, such a person have to live without realize oneself." And he asked me again, "How it can be compassion?" "The dead soul always demands (always needs) the body of the living person. They can express their intention (what they want) only through living body. So, when people practice meditation the result is that they give their own body to the dead people. So it is impossible for anyone to practice this without great compassion (mercy). In Thailand, there are several tens of thousands, maybe several hundred of thousand, monks here. I don't believe they do this (they practice this) because they don't know anything about this. So, I'm sure they practice meditation because of their mercy, and they think that compassion is the best teaching. The best way is that we go there and confirm." So, now we are sitting here. So, what is your purpose of practicing meditation. Is this from your compassion or from your&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>&hellip; compassion?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk:</strong> Just a moment&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*a sparse conversation occurs between the monks over the next few moments*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Master of meditation (via bikkhuni interpreter):</strong> The reason to practice meditation comes from confidence, but if you remember&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>From&hellip; confidence?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Bikkhuni: </strong>Confident.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Confident</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Faith</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Faith, ah&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Confidence</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Confidence&hellip; from faith.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>This confidence should have with wisdom.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Pardon?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>This confidence should have with wisdom</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>With wisdom</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Understanding</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Understanding</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Ah huh&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>What kind of wisdom do you mean?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Master of meditation (in English):</strong> Wisdom?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>"What kind of wisdom do you mean"</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> If you just waiting and listening little by little, you get understanding &ndash; not give the question, you won't understand it. Buddha said _________ [Editor's note: Couldn't make out this statement. Sounds like another language. ]&hellip; it means that you have to try to do by yourself and afterwards you will understanding by yourself&hellip; by explanation.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I am sitting in front of you right now and we are talking. But I can see in your body there are many of spirits (not even one, there are many of them inside). What did they make you realize (your guidances, what did they make you realize indeed)?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> This understanding is to understanding inside. Your body look outside.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>He said that you are in present moment, but right now you are listening to dharma, so it is through Buddhism you get understanding</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (without having Soyun's translation): </strong>I am looking into your inside (I can see your inside). But, you are doing what the ordinary people never can do.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> Insight meditation only personal meditation. It doesn't matter that you know everybody, but if you don't know yourself, not very big. The great benefit that Buddha taught is see yourself, to understand yourself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>So, what did you come know about yourself? (What do you know about you? Did you become to know you?)</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> Three things that you can know inside yourself. From this body and mind you will see everything in insight that in problems. Imperfectness are suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Imperfectness is suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Imperfectness are suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Imperfectness is suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> And then non-self. Unless it go, are no self&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Unless it go?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Ah&hellip; "let it go"&hellip; Non-self, or selflessness.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Okay, first is imper&ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Everybody can understand</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>First one is&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Impermanence.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Impermanence. He could know impermanence.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Impermanence.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Ah, impermanence. Okay. So, nothing is forever..? Okay, and?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Suffering.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Imperfectness.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Imperfectness.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>And third?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Last one is no-self</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>No self. *translates* So, he could know that? So, you could know from your meditation?</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (without having translation, in English):</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>It's very difficult to receive what you speak because you don't have substance (substantial thing) in your words.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It's very difficult to receive what you speak because when you say that there's no substantial (substance)</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (in English):</strong> Substantial&hellip; substance.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So it's very hard to receive that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*M begins to speak to bukkhuni*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata begins to speak after a moment*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>*Master of meditation and bukkhuni begin to laugh while Tathagata is speaking*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When you speak something to others you should have a certain matters and problems so that the other person understands what you speak. But I can't find any problems in what you speak. So, the ignorant people can be deceived by what you speak but the wise man finds it very difficult to understand.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*after speaking with bukkuni, M and bukkhuni begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via bikkhu interpreter):</strong> You come here, right&hellip;? You should question what you want to know. The specific question (specific question), you should ask question like <span style="font: 11.0px Helvetica;">&ndash; </span>you don't have&hellip; you don't want to know the real answer, just compare things, compare like this&hellip;. Please ask him to ask the specific and then monks will answer the questions rightly.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monks laughing as Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When we came here, we wanted to ask you about meditation. If I speak then let me know what is wrong in what I say. But, when you point that I'm wrong, then you should suggest (you should tell me) the problem (what do I wrong with what kind of problem).</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via bikkhu):</strong> When you ask question, you should not ask many questions at the same time. You just ask one thing and then you will get the answer&ndash; then then stop, right? And then start questioning again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monks begin to laugh loudly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>That's a good idea.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata and Soyun laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Bikkhu: </strong>Okay, monk say that,</p>

<p style=""><strong>M: </strong>If you ask, continuously ask question again and again like this, monk get to wonder how to answer these questions.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>There are two questions about practicing meditation. If somebody practices meditation as they know the secret of meditation, has great mercy (or compassion). But if somebody practices meditation because they don't know the secret of it, then they are ignorant. Because of their ignorance, they practice meditation. So, could you understand why I speak like this?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> You should ask the meditator what they practice and then what they will get from the practice. You should not judge or criticize by your thought without putting your thought to practice first.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs, and then some monks laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> As he saw you, so he's already known everything what could you get from your meditation. He already understands everything about you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>and I could see what kind of result will come from the meditation through you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (in English):</strong> Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via bikkhu):</strong> If you know already what the meditator or monks who practice meditation get, you should not ask the question because you know already the answer.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monks begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>No. This is very, very important for people who live in the world. Otherwise, I shouldn't come here.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>This subject is very important for people in this world. Do you know? If it is not so important, we shouldn't come here. We've lots of expenses. We came from England.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Do you mind if I speak the truth (the fact) here? Do you mind if I speak to you what I've seen?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B (interpreting for meditation master):</strong> He doesn't mind</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It's okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Okay. Life has two things: body, and consciousness. Our body is nothing more than a tool (instrument), and consciousness does something that it needs by using this tool (the body).</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via bikkhu):</strong> In Buddhism, these things were taught for long time since the Buddha's time until now's days.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>So he agrees about this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Yes he agrees about this.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But, when you practice meditations, then dead soul can come into body. (You call the dead spirit come in.)</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (in English):</strong> No! No&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Bikkhu (without content from M):</strong> No. No soul&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*some bikkhu begin to laugh and a monk begins to talk after Tathagata starts speaking*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>No, no, not the same, different idea.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But do you know who are inside you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Monk (in English): </strong>No. Different area</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>There many different guidances in you</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>No no no&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Don't you know who they are?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I prove that</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Sorry&hellip; different area, not same, not same&hellip; Let me tell something, okay, please? Yes he has knowledge about this, he has expressed, he can talk, but if debate each other about this thing, for what ? In Buddhism, we have different ideas, from this, we don't believe in soul, we don't believe in spirit, okay? But we believe in the mind. The mind can be practiced, and could be good, and could be bad, according to your practice. But he only criticize himself, he don't accept anything!</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> But sorry, but, he's speaking with him.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He wants speak with him.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Right, right&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Not your opinion.</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Okay&hellip; The same idea. Buddhist idea.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; Buddhist idea.. same idea?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Then can you agree (can you accept) the souls in your body?</p>

<p style=""><strong>M: </strong>No.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But you don't understand what situation are you in now.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*after a moment*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> We have different ideas. I cannot accept yours.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>No. Everything in this world is fixed, and every answers is fixed. And the answers are made by the questions. So you are a monk, and you became monk, maybe many years ago, and if the monks don't know the cause make the result, then they are not real monk.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> Many, many ideas formulated until now, just now only one idea. Many, many views.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>All the facts can be revealed when we check. If you think that what I speak is wrong, then do you agree that we check together? (We confirm)</p>

<p style=""><strong>*after B translates for M, bukkhuni speaks to M and then bukkhuni begins to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> In Buddhist idea, training or practicing mediation, Buddhist view about meditation, is a personal experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Yes&hellip; you should have told us before. But it will be a crime (sin) if you don't tell others about the result of meditation before you teach them others.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>So you think this is&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>"It will be sin of you if you don't tell the result of training of meditation when you recommend to others"</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (in English): </strong>Simple example&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B (translating for M): </strong>The monk say that when you arrive in Thailand, when you are hungry, okay, you find the restaurant to eat to solve your hunger. You passed the buyer, and buyer never asks you where are you from or whatever, but he will sell the food to you. Meditation also you just come and practice first before questions. Okay? Hard practice, and then you can question as the result.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>This young man asked me, "What will happen if I practice meditation?" So I answered, &ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*M begins to speak*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B (interpreting for M):</strong> The monk, he says that we don't know the result of the others people doing meditating but he only know himself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Only himself&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Yeah, only himself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Not any other person&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Not any other person, but any other person, they practice, they will know themselves also and then when they have some questions, they can come and ask monk and get the answer.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Some people who give questions to you are ignorant, so they don't know the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> But he can see this world. It doesn't matter about your answers. He only tell on proof.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B (interpreting for M):</strong> He says about the problems in the world, okay&hellip; you should not know another things, if you know all things, the problems in the world can be aimed never right but you should calm down yourself to make the peace, to bring peace happening in yourself first. It means to have peaceful mind, to calm or start from yourself, learn from yourself first, right, and then&hellip; you will see the world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata starts laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Anyway, do you understand English? A little bit&hellip; Just we are wondering if he understands what he speak</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Yeah he understands some things</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Some things</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Some words I explain to him</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Some words</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>It's impossible between us (you and me) to talk because if I ask something in the west, you answer in the east.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> We speak different languages and different views of thinking, that's why we will never get answer from each other.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Okay. Then please answer if you can understand this world. In Thailand, there are numerous monks and there are so many teachers who teach Buddhist scriptures and so many students who learn Buddhist scriptures. Could you tell me is there even one person who knows what Buddha taught (Buddha's teaching)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*people begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Oh, okay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I bet&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M (via B):</strong> Just like you only know, not monk. You only know about&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monk laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>How do you know that I am only one person who knows Buddha's teaching?</p>

<p style=""><strong>B (interpreting):</strong> Just what he says now&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monks laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Bikkhuni: </strong>Thank you for come to visit us</p>

<p style=""><strong>Bikkhu: </strong>In a moment we will teach meditation to the practitioners&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>What is your reason that you only try to learn wrong meditation, but you don't try to learn so good Buddha's teaching (Buddha's teaching is so good)?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>M: </strong>Oh, good&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Why don't you try to learn Buddha's teaching but only practice wrong meditation?</p>

<p style=""><strong>M: </strong>Okay. In your idea (your view), not my view</p>

<p style=""><strong>*monk laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>M: </strong>Your view!</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>In this country, I bet 10 million baht &ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>B: </strong>Ah, sorry&hellip; it's very impolite if you talk about money or you talk about bet money with monks&hellip; sorry if I say this, because we have talk for three times already in this&hellip;</p>
