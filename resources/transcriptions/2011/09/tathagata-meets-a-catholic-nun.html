<h3>Tathagata visits a Catholic church</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Catholic Nun</strong><strong>:</strong> Nice meeting you. What can I help you with?</p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Tathagata: </strong>I see many people go to church and I become to think there may be good in church. Is this the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok?</span></p>
<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English): </strong>Number one?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata): </strong>Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Today we meet first time so do you mind if I ask something that I'm wondering? May I ask you your age?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> I'm 70.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When did you become a nun?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> 50 years ago.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So, did you become a nun, not married?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> No.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Coffee and water arrive, with cookies*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Did you have any special motivation to become a nun at that time?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> I was attracted by this when I was very young.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You lived in the church for 50 years, then probably you learned lots of things during this life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Is that right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In this world, there are numerous people who rely on the church. They rely on church very much. What is the reason of their faith: because church has teaching, or God?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Church has teaching&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mm, or God? What is the reason of their faith?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>I think that church will have to have faith in God, belief in God, you see? So it's the duty of the church to spread the good &ndash; we call it good news &ndash; about God.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When you say God, then, the range of the object of the word is extremely big. When you say God, what do you mean? Do you mean, Holy Spirit or any other object?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> For us Catholic, we believe that God is the author of life. He has power to rule the Earth, he created the world, created all human beings and rules everything what exists in the world. And that's God, above any gods that people believe, that's the God, maybe, even Buddhism, they are praying for their Buddha, as kind of a, what do you call this, the preacher, a good man, what, for us, yes, Buddha is a good man, but there is someone above that who made, created, everything. That's God for us. We belong to God, we exist because of the power of God to protect us.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Is there any relationship between the churches and the creator, or Church borrows the name of God to manage and run their organization?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> What you call this relationship, the church, surely we have relationship with the creator, who is, we are creatures being created by God. So sure we belong to God. So the church is the members of those Catholics we have together in every part of the world, that we call the church, who kind of, are the followers of Christ, who believe in God the creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What you explained just before, is it based on a kind of evidence (proof), or it came from the ideas of human beings?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The belief of Catholics, the belief of faith&hellip; we believe that there is God and we adore that God who with us creates everything. And God is supreme in our life, we do anything, we try to obey the law given by God, by the church, to live a good life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You mentioned about the law that is given by the creator. Then what do you mean by the law?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The law means the rule of life to live a good life. Now I want to say, there's no evidence like in science to prove this, prove that, but we have faith in God. God is teaching, we have the Holy Bible, with the teaching of Christ. And that is our law of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have become more interested in talking to you. Can I confirm the teaching of Jesus in the Bible?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then could you teach me only one or could you share one teaching in Bible?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Instantly, now?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes. Only one. Not many.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Teaching of Christ is the son of God, as we believe in Christmas, God became man, and we call he's the son of God, came on Earth to live as man. He is not anything extra, being a child, born in a stable, and then he grow up. His job is go around teaching people to do good, and also there is no difference from him the poor, the rich, or all those who suffered, the sick. He's especially the friend of the poor and the sick, because the plan of God is to save all mankind, no matter he's sick or poor, he's a sinner or a good man, he wants everyone to be saved. And that's what we read about in the Bible, that God, the son of God, came down on Earth, to help, to save people, to lead a good life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So you introduce that one for us in Bible, the teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What you've told before, the church made this story for 2,000 years, or did you tell us the proof of the real life of Jesus?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> We mean the Gospel. The Gospel had been written, just now, all the history written, what happened 2,000 years ago, even before that we have the Old Testament, and the New Testament, all Testaments are both experiences by the people living during the time of Jesus or before Jesus was born. It's all recorded.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But the history was written by human beings who worked for the church.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> All those who witnessed what's happening, you know?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Witnessed</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then, I'd like to ask you your opinion. I heard from you Christ was more kind to the sick and the poor people. Mother Theresa who lived in India, actually is recorded as a nun who devoted her life for the sick and the poor. When we see record, Christ and Mother Theresa have done the same thing. But, Mother Theresa had honor and respect and adored so much by people when she was alive. But, about Jesus Christ, we cannot find any record he was adored and respected and had fame when he was alive at the time. Is there any difference between what Christ had done and Mother Theresa?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> It is easy now, that Mother Theresa believed in the teaching of Christ. She gave up her life even with her sisters too to help the poor. That's the example of Christ when he was alive.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then, the teaching of Christ is very dangerous, isn't it? I'm talking about the aspect of soul.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Dangerous?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Dangerous</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I heard about the fame of Mother Theresa, so I went to India. When I visited Calcutta, she was not there at the time. But I had seen several tens of orphans and disabled children. Of course, several tens of orphans and disabled children were supported by Mother Theresa's activities. But, she collected huge donation from every part of the world because of those children. But she spent only less than 1% of donation for the poor. But we can't confirm the rest of 99% donation is used for what. It doesn't seem that Jesus Christ taught such dangerous thing. So, we really want to know what is true teaching of Jesus. I can see your soul is much more higher than the soul of Mother Theresa. Mother Theresa cannot be reborn (revive) as a human being. Do you believe that the Bible has the real teaching of Christ? Jesus sacrificed his own life for humankind. So, his teaching should be revealed in this world. If the churches hide good teaching, instead, they make God stand. This is sin.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> They make God&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Stand. They always represent only God, not teaching.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Even tarot can do make god stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*The door buzzes, and then someone enters the room*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Entrant: </strong>Good morning!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Good morning!</p>

<p style=""><strong>*A brief side conversation takes place*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've lived over 60 years now and during my life, I had a big question about the church. Many people are Christian, they go to church, but all of them always call the name God. They always make God stand, and many of them are always pray (chanting, singing) for receiving Holy Spirit. Then could you tell me, what is God and what is the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>Now for us, there are three persons in God. God the father, his work, he's the creator, create the world, God the father. And God the son who came down to be a child. And God the Holy Spirit, he's the spirit of God, who animates, who uplifts us all, who gives a blessing to people, especially encouragement in time of difficulties, that's the Holy Spirit's job. We have different parts of our body that Christ (God) has got something like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The creator you say is worried about human world, but it never contact humankind, and God never give birth child. Then what is the evidence that Jesus is the son of the creator? Third, I want to know about the Holy Spirit. Can I understand as the soul of the dead is the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The soul of the dead&hellip; the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yea</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The dead person&hellip; like you and me, we have two lives, the body is a life, but you have another life, that's the spirit within you. When a person dies, his body, the spirit is out of his body, that's why he's dead. Personally now, I am just feeling that your questions are going deeper and deeper, but if you are interested to learn religion, there must be a long course. It's not by questions like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You've already passed that long course. So it will not be so difficult a job for you to help us understand.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>No, no&hellip; I mean that there must be following study. It's not just a conversation like that&hellip; you have to see the Bible, this is our text to study.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Teaching always in the questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yes, if the questions are based on something&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People can't learn anything if the question cannot be revealed. You've already known one thing. You said we have two lives: body and soul. Then, is it right if I regard the body as a kind of instrument (tool)? And is it right if I understand that the soul is like a car driver that controls the car, like the soul is growing up by using the activities of body? So soul is like driver and body is like car?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Is it correct, can you understand like this, soul and body?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> No, sometimes the body is directing the soul.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Body is?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Is kind of a driver.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Body is kind of a driver?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Because a soul, soul is inactive, it's within you, the soul cannot tell you, this is right, that is wrong. But if the body wants to do the own way, it's against the feeling within you, it will.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> According to my common sense, I haven't found this case that the body is the driver for soul. When somebody receives Holy Spirit, then they have two drivers in one body, and if they receive more Holy Spirits, it means they have more drivers.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> There is only one spirit. There is one spirit coming from God. That is ideas maybe, you know? Within you, you learn a lot, so you believe in this and that, you kind of directed your life. But the spirit of God, there is a new one, there is no divisions, no divisions&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If somebody speaks something that they haven't seen, it's a lie. Or, if somebody saw something then they must explain what they saw in order that the other people can understand. So if they don't have very clear evidence in what they speak, it means that they haven't seen exactly. I don't say it is bad that some people receive Holy Spirit, but I have been wondering how people give up their soul and receive others' soul? This is my first case.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> How is it possible for human beings?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> That's influence.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> That's influence&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The influence of all around us, you know? Especially at present times, there are so many bad influences, and look at the young generations, they will not do what the parents teach them, tell them to do. But the _______ [Note: couldn't make out this word], the trends, all what's happened around them, that is man's spirit coming into realignment.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When I see the life of Christ, I cannot believe that Jesus taught you should receive Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Jesus taught&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> May I repeat&hellip; He said, When he observes the life of Jesus Christ, he doesn't believe that Christ told people you should receive Holy Spirit.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Person really seek Holy Spirit or not, it's not because Christ told, but person personally, you have faith in God, and Christ is teaching all what God wants us to know. But then it's like you, you want to believe or not, you want to receive Holy Spirit or not, it's up to each one of us. It's not Christ force you to receive the Holy Spirit. It's faith that we need to do.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If people followed the modern church's instruction, then more and more people will receive Holy Spirit in the future. Jesus' work and Mother Theresa's work look similar, but when people see them, they had a different understanding from people. Jesus understood what true love was, and he practiced the true love. Mother Theresa had done the similar mission, but she only used the poor and the unhappy, miserable people, without understanding love. Because Jesus practiced love, that's why he didn't obtain anything except good mind. That's why nobody yearned (envied) Jesus. But people could see what Mother Theresa obtained by using the poor. She could get huge wealth (huge money). That's why so many people adored her (envied her). When I went to India for the first time, I asked to journalists, "Who could you recommend for the meeting and talking in India?" Most of them recommended me, "Oh, you should meet Mother Theresa here." But, we found very interesting consequences. Jesus couldn't obtain anything but his soul could reach heaven. But Mother Theresa enjoyed fame and money. She didn't know any lacking in her late age. But she had to go the most dreadful path. If people don't realize 'what is', they are like the blind. I hope the teaching of Jesus Christ will brighten again in this world by your effort. At that time, we will be able to be real sisters and brothers. The Bible was written by the hand of human beings, and also was written by the people who has Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>And also, the four Gospels, Matthew, Luke, Mark, John, they lived in the time of Christ. What is written there is because they witnessed what Christ did. So that we, this generation, should be able to know what was happening during that time.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I agree there are some records about the activities of Jesus Christ at that time and what he told to people. But, I'm sorry for this point in the Bible, but people who wrote about the activities of Jesus Christ and the teaching of him, had a very huge gap of level of consciousness between Jesus. That's why they couldn't understand really about him and they couldn't write down properly. Because the teaching of Jesus was not told rightly in the Bible, that's why if we see Jesus now, he looks like the king of the devil. We will be able to save mankind only when we revive the teaching of Jesus and his sacrifice. Could you teach me where can I find somebody who really wants to follow Jesus? (Please tell me where can I find someone who is a real follower of Jesus.)</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Someone?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Someone, yeah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> There are priests in the rectory. A priest is supposed to be someone who is teaching, who is living the life of Christ. He's Christ's representative at this time. As an ordained priest, his job is to perform all the sacrifices and he teaches those who want to learn more about Christ, about Christian teaching.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Thank you very much for your kindness.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> You know we have two priests working in Korea, the priests from this organization working in Korea.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> How many priests do you have?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> About seven.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> About seven?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Seven. They go to different places, they are assigned to different work.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Okay. So when you say priest, you don't&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> If you go to the rectory, you'll find someone.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, find someone. Not any&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (secretary, sound engineer):</strong> Like specifically&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, specific man&hellip; no?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Who you think is better&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> They are all able to help you&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It was helpful for us to understand the churches.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> You seem to know a lot about Christians&hellip; Catholics&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata chuckles*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He is a scientist.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Scientists sometimes&hellip; want proof, evidence&hellip; but religion is not to prove, to have real evidence. We accept the teaching we believe.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We can understand the teaching only through the problems. But I am sorry that religious teaching doesn't have any questions (any problems). But I am very surprised that the people who has religion are mostly very brave and have the spirit of sacrifice. But, people, like us, cannot give my soul to Holy Spirit even though I have 10,000 times of birth.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>10,000&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Times of birth.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Births. Even we are born 10,000 times&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Reborn.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Reborn. Recreation&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Recreation,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S, Satto:</strong> Reincarnation&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Reincarnation&hellip; You are Buddhist?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world exists by transmigration and they revive everything what happened in them by transmigration. This is the secret that makes this world exist. Of course, if you make people realize, then there's no way religion can survive. When people are awakened, this world will be changed as the world of humankind, not the world of spirits. I don't know anything but, for you, I'd like to tell you one thing. Jesus came down to Earth not for making this world of gods (spirits) but for humankind. (He wanted to make this world for human beings.) But the churches use the will of Jesus adversely (in the opposite way), and this is to kill Jesus again. We have to repent and joy by 'what is' in the present. I would like to be your friend. Is it possible?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> But you are one!&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> There are good people and bad people. But every society, some are very good, and trying to help one another. But, you mention about the church, the church is, all the Catholics, who have been baptized, who are Catholics, but of course Catholics that've been baptized, they're not a passport to go to heaven, or to be good always, they're human beings. So they're tempted by the devils. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they misbehave. That's human beings.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> How about you? Being a real person, you are 70 years old. I am 63. You are older than me, but it will make a problem if I like you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You are a virgin, but I am married once.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> But we can be friends&hellip; There's no objection for that. We can be friends.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> We can be friends&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (laughing):</strong> Spiritually, let's be close. When I come here again, I'll speak a little more English. I will study.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Are you staying here in Bangkok?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> At the moment, all of you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, we are travelers&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Travelers&hellip; to different places&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; we are a group.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> To study more about religion, is that right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's right. We want to learn things in universities and religion. But so far, what we've learned from universities and religions is too low level.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> What university did you go to?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We've been to lots of famous universities.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>You mean in Bangkok, or anywhere&hellip;? Chulalongkorn, Assumption&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Low in which way?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Low?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The content that they teach&hellip;. I could find some good people among the students but I couldn't find any desirable person among professors. There are more possibilities to ruin people if they have wrong education. I became an orphan when I was very young, so I had to stop my schooling in the primary school. When I visited universities I was very proud of myself because I haven't learned in schools. If some people ask me what philosophy is, then I can answer what philosophy is, but when I met many of professors in philosophy department, nobody could answer to my question what the philosophy is. I don't understand why every professors were very scared of me when they met me. I don't have any knife or guns&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun and Tathagata laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> They always ran away from me. If I ask only one question, they always said, "Oh I don't have time, I'm very busy&hellip;" So I don't know what do they know. They are better than me in one point. They speak lie very fluently.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Speak&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Speak lie (falsehood)</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He really want you were a little bit younger&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T (speaking in English):</strong> Can you make me &hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> Okay&hellip; Can you make me happy?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He's learning English.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He practiced this one sentence for one week but now he wants to speak something to you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> I think he have already&hellip; it's correct&hellip; now continue what you are saying&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He wanted to speak to you just before, "Could you date with me now?"</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Date&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Date, date, he wants a date.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Date. So, he doesn't need translators. He only wants date with you, so hold hand, and go out for dinner,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Say in English</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> That's why now he decided that he will practice English and after that he will come here again to meet you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah, he says, "It's no problem, when a man date with a loving woman, then speaking not necessary." So he become happy if he only see each other.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have one skill. I have a power if I really want to expand somebody's life, I can. I will stay in this planet 10 years more from now. If you die before me, I'll be lonely,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laugh and someone claps hands*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So I will help you to live more 11 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> Can you calculate, he will stay in this planet more 10 years, so he wants you stay also in this planet&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> So we meet next world&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you want to become my lover or my friend in the next world, then I should bring you to heaven. But, you should find the way to heaven in yourself. I can open the way then, could you go the way (the way to heaven)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> This is what I am doing now. I am on the way to heaven in my life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world is predestined, and these determined things can find the way in the problems. No matter how you may wish to go to heaven, it is impossible for you if you don't know the way. If you can give me one right answer to my 1,000 questions, then you are the person who can go to heaven. Nobody can go heaven through church. Jesus came to Earth to build the way but he failed. Then, where can you find the way? There is only one man who knows the way in living people. Look at my face. If I speak you truth or untruth. In the appearance of the saints who stayed in legend, we can find a saint who has a real third eye. Only such being can know the way to heaven. Now we became friends, so please look at my face. I have an eye on my forehead. This is the eye that can see the ways. This is not a bonk.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Can you see that? No?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> From the side</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Can you see what's in his forehead?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> He has here, like a&hellip; the outside.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you can promise to be my friend then I can give you everything that you want. My duty in this age is to find out people who is like Jesus, and this civilization will disappear very soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> This civilization&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> This world, this current world&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Many prophets foretold this age will have the end of the world. I want to save the human world again. For 20 years, I have been trying for this and I visited universities and religions but nobody has interest in my mission (my activities). I can take off all my clothes to draw people's attention and I can sit down on the street with naked</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then, maybe many people will pay attention. But it will not go for a long time because police will come immediately and say, "You break the law!" That's why I'm very stuffy now (anxious). I'm looking for Jesus in this world but there's no way to meet. So please be Christ by yourself!</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> I would invite you to go to our church and see, you sit with time to yourself, quietly a while, maybe you'll find Jesus there.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, spirits with falsehood never can approach to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> You just try and give yourself to the chapel - have you stopped at the church?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes we stopped. But he says, "I want living Jesus. (I want living Christ.)"</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> How long will you be here, going out, visiting the country?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Actually, he has traveling about 50 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Going 'round the country here?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Here? We are going to Chiangmai tomorrow, stay there for about five days, and go to Kuala Lumpur, and following that we will go to Korea.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>We have sisters working there in Kuala Lumpur too, in Malaysia&hellip;. And find Christ. Go and find Jesus Christ in Kuala Lumpur, in Chiangmai&hellip; there are nice people.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yes, I continue to look for them, but I'm not sure if it's possible&hellip;. I cannot trust what people speak. For example, Mother Theresa. Her work was not right. She had excellent talent to induce people's donations, and there's nobody who had more success than her by using the poor people, very miserable people. In spite of her work what she has done, people call her as a saint. Then, whom can we believe and trust? We shouldn't believe something that is not verified. So remember this. You shouldn't keep everything under the Holy Spirit's custody. &hellip; If we could met when you were 26, and I was 21, then I would depend you, "Please don't be nun, marry me!"</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So we met too late. Maybe you looked very pretty when you were young&hellip; everybody praised you&hellip;. But don't worry, still I really want to travel with you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Satto and Soyun laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And we could have a meal together, and drink tea together&hellip; sleep together?</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laughing and having a good time*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Have a long life. Let's meet again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Thank you! Thank you&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Do you mind if I hold your hand once?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (laughing):</strong> Is it safe? It is too direct?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> No&hellip; if it's just meeting friends like that, it's alright. It's nothing special, isn't it?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, I don't want special relationship&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Okay, have a nice trip and new year. Bless you all.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> We were very pleased&hellip;.</p>


<hr />



<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Good morning!</p>

<p style=""><strong>Catholic priest:</strong> Hi! What can I do for you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Hello.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We came here to have some good news (teaching).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> You want teaching, or you want a job to be a teacher, or what?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> No, no, we want to listen some teachings from the church.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Priest and Tathagata begin to laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> You say, "good news"? What's that ?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We've heard this is the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok. Is it true?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting priest):</strong> Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> So we came here to meet some priests who can introduce about the Catholic teaching. Could you introduce some priests to save our soul.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Normally what I do is that I give you a booklet. You want to read about the Catholic faith, the church, preaching, or let you know about our Catholic faith. After that when you have some ideas then we're gonna come and explain to you what you want to know about this and other topics, what the teaching of the church concerning with certain subject. When you just come in and you want to know about Catholic faith it's so long and so big and it takes so much time, but if you have a booklet, you want to follow the teaching which one is for what, you know?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We've read many books already. But, I couldn't find answer about life in any books. I saw so many people go church, and I have questions. What can I obtain if I go to church? I started my travel to find the answer of life. I wanted to know the right answer what is the way of life and how we should live. This morning, I asked to the staff in my hotel, "Where is the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok?" So they told us to come here.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Our church here is not the biggest one in Bangkok&hellip; our church here is catering to English speaking people. We have more schedules for masses in English than in Thai.&nbsp; The main church here in Bangkok is the Cathedral &ndash; the Assumption Cathedral. It's in Bang Rak area, it's where Oriental Hotel&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oriental Hotel?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yeah. That's the main church. So our mass schedule here is catering to English speaking people. Okay, if you want to come in the other room here so I can&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*movement occurs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> So mass is for Sunday. We have nine masses, two on Saturday afternoon, and seven on Sunday. And out of nine here we have four Thai masses for the native and we have five for English-speaking people. Especially on a big day like Christmas or Easter, we have a special mass schedule for all people. So&hellip; you know, here we are catering to the needs of the people. This church has many foreigners attending mass here. We have from different nations: Africa, from Asia, Europe, Eastern Europe, from America, &hellip;. And in the area here, we do not have parishioners because before it was a slum but now they developing into high rise and it's so expensive. No ordinary people stay in this area, so people that come to church here normally have to drive, take public transportation to come to our mass.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Personal teaching?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yeah, please.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When did you become a priest?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Oh, about 30 years ago.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> 30&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> And I'm 63 years old. I've been a pastor here for three years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You look so young!</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He's 63, but looks like a younger man!</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> I'm an old man!&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I envy you!</p>

<p style=""><strong>*laughing*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What is the duty of church? Is your duty to spread God to people or to spread teaching?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> We have different functions. In priesthood, some evangelize by media, radio, television, newspaper. For us, mainly, to taking care of the people who come to this church. So, not only who come to this church, we have to prepare them for the sacraments. We prepare them for baptism, marriage, and burial. So, not only preaching and have mass for them, but we have other sacraments we help with for people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you do such kind of things, then any other places also perform them, not even only church.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> See, as I said, we have at least ten churches in the Bangkok area here: St. Louis, Assumption, and many other churches, okay&hellip; but this one is very different because the person that came and set up this church here from America, loved the Thai culture and customs, so we built the church in Thai style &ndash; not the Buddhist style, but Thai style. And our church here has been built for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Church has been built&hellip; for 50 years?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> 50 years.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Do you have any differences between the Catholic and other religions?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Yes we do. The Roman Catholic that we are preaching and preserving is special, but other Christian churches with different denominations, there is Anglican, Church of Christ, Baptist, Mormon, they originally believed in Christ, but the way they practice is very different from Catholic faith.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> As you said that what you work here, like wedding, funeral, or building schools, those things are the same as social thing (social work). So if you do just such things, is it really that church is necessary for people's life?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>Because a lot of time we think in the Catholic faith we have seven sacraments, baptism, confirmation, holy communion, confession, anointing, marriage, and ordination to the priesthood. So what we do is that we take care of the people, not only they were born and be baptized, but then they are sick, we have to reach them &ndash; at home, hospital, we have to give them the sacraments preparing for the journey. We believe that our life here on Earth is very short, comparing. So we have to prepare them not only when they are healthy but when they are sick. If it is the will of God that they have to die then we prepare them to die.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've known you teach about human life. Is it true&hellip; no?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> People's life. We're teaching about people's life, it's not about humans, a process, or steps&hellip;. Taking human life by means of abortion is wrong, taking life by euthanasia is wrong. So our teaching is God created us, we have body and soul. We are not like animals, you know, chickens, or ducks, or dogs, or other things. Our human soul is immortal. Yes? You know, when we die, our body and soul will be in heaven with God. So that's a thing we consider the dignity of the person. We are sacred, immortal in the eye of God. We were cremated&ndash; created, in the image of God. So we share the life of Christ. So this is meaning of the mass when we come and offer ourselves to God, and we receive the body and blood of Christ as part of our life.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You say about the life of Jesus, then what sort of life did Jesus live?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Jesus Christ believed in Judaism, Jesus is a Jew. So he knows about the Old Testament, the holy scriptures in the past before him. In the Bible, we divide into two parts. One is called the Old Testament and the other one is the New Testament. Old Testament is about from creation until John the Baptist. The New Testament started with Jesus until the last of his apostles.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If Jesus believed in Judaism, but I know that Jesus was killed by Jews. Then, he was a traitor of Judaism?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> It's a long history of the Old Testament, but what I would like to explain very shortly is that when Adam and Eva, or Adam and Eve, according to the Bible, you know the Bible happened a long time ago, but in written language, we believe about 4,000 years ago, so we have tradition. We have the story, that moral teaching of what happened. So we believe that's God. God created the human being, whether real Adam and Eve, we don't care. We care it's that God created our human being.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> How can you prove that Creator created human beings?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> We call that science, you know, we know that the human person, the bones and structure, may be hundred thousand years ago. That's human being &ndash; people &ndash; living long time ago. But as I said, the Bible, we have characters, letters, put into common language we can communicate about 4,000 years ago. We have history, we have tradition, we have four fathers &ndash; the fathers, the son, and the grandson, so this is what we believe, there's a God, there's a God who created our human being. Okay. But when the four fathers commit sin, they want to be like God, you know. Sins, what you call it &ndash; original sin. But God promised to send a savior. So when Abraham was called to be the father of faith for the Jewish people, then the Jewish people, the chosen race, believed that the Messiah will be born one of these days to redeem mankind. So Jesus Christ knows about the promise in the past. He knew about the Ten Commandments. He knew about Moses, he knew about David, he knows everything in the Old Testament. But he's not happy with &ndash; there's a teaching with, you know, letter, law, and command. Jesus Christ was born as the Messiah but people did not expect him to be the Messiah. Because the Jews expect the Messiah to be great king, big army, power, money, to overthrow the Romans who occupied Palestine during that time. But Jesus came, he said, "I'm really king. But king for the poor, the sick, the suffering, people who are looking for faith and the truth." So Jesus Christ changed the teaching, the meaning of the law, and the meaning of people's lives is love &ndash; forgiveness. And that's why when he was born, not so many people accepted him. Because he's different from what they expected as great king, royal family, big army, money, power.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then, did Jesus do similar thing that recently Mother Theresa has done in India?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Mother Theresa did not do the thing she's supposed to do because of Jesus Christ, she did it because Jesus taught her how to do it &ndash; love the poor, take care of the dignity of the person. Mother Theresa, without Jesus Christ, she wouldn't do it. I remember one day, Mother Theresa washing the wounds of the sick, the dying, had no hope of recovery. The doctor said, "What a waste of time, you are doing this&hellip; The person's gonna die anyway. If you give me a million rupees, I won't do it." Mother Theresa said, "If it helps Christ, I'll do it. I do it because of Christ." That's why, you said that Jesus did the same thing as Mother Theresa, I have to switch around. Mother Theresa believed in Jesus Christ, that's why Mother Theresa did many good things. Without Jesus Christ, she wouldn't do it.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I am become confused when I listened to you. I don't understand this point. Christ had same thing, he took care of the poor, sick, and the unhappy people at the time, but he was not received by people at the time. But Mother Theresa practiced the same thing, but she had very great respect and was adored. Why is it so different in the result?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> The teaching of Christ is just from a small group. Maybe ten thousand, maybe a hundred thousand, but he picked only twelve people to represent him. And then before he died, before he went to heaven, he said go out and tell people the good news what I did. Tell them about my teaching, tell them about my life. So, from twelve people, they went out to different places and twelve picked other people to teach or preach. So mouth to mouth, okay? We had no television, no newspaper, no diary, no laptop, no computer. But people, it's 2,000 years ago, you know? But Mother Theresa, one of Jesus' disciples, she learned about Jesus Christ, about his work, that's why she started doing it. Mother Theresa had many objections. Many people thought that she get the money, she getting wealthy, not because for the poor, but for herself. In Thailand, we have four sisters from India working like Mother Theresa in Nong Bua Lamphu. I was the one that invited them and set up the place for them and now they're working for AIDS victims, for the orphans, for people that are dying. So they carry on this work. Not so many people recognize this. They say, where is Nong Bua Lamphu, where is the sisters? Yes, we have television, we have newspapers, but it's not well known yet. Mother Theresa, because she dared to speak against the wealthy nations, against the people who took advantage of the poor and sick, that's why she was famous. And people were watching her all the time, when she got donations, they say, "Aha. She get rich." No. She send people to different places. Even in America, Sister Theresa sent nuns to work there. In Singapore, in Russia, in different places, even in Thailand.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>When I listen more and more to you, then I become more impressed. Jesus told his twelve disciples, go and teach</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Tell the good news</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Tell the good news,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> and transfer my teaching. Then what is the teaching of Jesus?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> There's one God that created everything. We call it the profession of faith. The prayer that we have the core of the teaching, we call it the charisma, what we have to believe: there's one God. God created everything. God created human beings, God sent his son Jesus Christ to redeem mankind. God sent the Holy Spirit to build up the church, to help the apostles, the disciples of Christ to spread the good news. Christ teach us that one day we gonna die, but if we persevere, if we believe in him and his teaching, our body die but our soul never die when we believe in the life after. That means God will welcome into his kingdom. He teach about the church, that carry on the mission of Christ. God will be with his church until the end of time. No one can destroy his church. The members of the church are people in heaven we call the saints, people who die who still have not purified we call people in purgatory, and we have the people that journey on this Earth still doing good, sometimes sins, but we are on the journey to the kingdom. So three members of Jesus Christ's church: people still alive we call the pilgrim's church, people who die but still in purgatory, in purification, we call the church suffering, and those that won the victory, that means they were purified, in heaven, we call the saints. So this is the teaching of Christ. They're talking about God, his role as the redeemer, how he has the holy spirit who give us power, give us light, give us special graces, and talking about the church. Jesus Christ is the head of the church, but he left that power to his apostles which he called the pope, the head of the church. And the church have to leave a light, we call it the pilgrim's church. So in the pilgrim's church we need praise, we need the sacraments, we need support so that they will persevere in their faith. They will keep the faith that Jesus Christ taught, and his disciples taught through the church.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Are you sure that what you explained to me about the teaching of Jesus is absolutely correct? We can contact very easily some people who always represent God (always make God stand) when they have spirits in them. But Saints always tried to teach people (to awake people) and when they teach something they always pointed out 'what is'. The difference between the Saints and the ordinary people is that they are not controlled (they are not influenced) by spirits, and the Saints never make god stand, and I believe that Jesus is a Saint. I can't believe that Jesus had the other spirit in him or Jesus made god stand, and god never give birth child. So it is impossible god has son (child). Then it means Jesus told untruth. I can't believe this fact.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> There are many thing about God is a mystery because we are human, he is divine. One of the professors, very smart and he wrote hundreds, hundreds of books, he would like to explain about God by simple language that people can understand. He had to believe but he would like to explain it to the people. So he was walking the sea shore, you know, water, and sand, he tried to think what language he's gonna explain about God, God the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit, three persons, why one? Why we call God? Why the three persons are equal? Why God this thing, and that. Why, why, why? So many questions. So he tried to think. He was walking on the sea shore and he saw a boy digging the hole in the sand, and used a shell and scooped the water and put it in the hole. So he walked back and forth, he saw that, finally he stopped and said, "What are you doing?" and the child said, "I tried to get all the water in the ocean to fit in the hole." And this professor said, "You're stupid, you're stupid, how can you do that?" And the child stood up and said, "You, a human person, you have a small brain. Why you think so much about God that you didn't know, why you try to narrow God down to your own thinking and your own language? It's easier for me to put the ocean water in the hole than for you to think about God in the written language." So many thing is a mystery. Jesus Christ never lied. Jesus Christ said my father and the holy spirit, he mentioned many times in the Bible, in the scriptures. He mentioned that the father and I and the holy spirit are working together. He would never lie, because he teach &ndash; if he lies, then his church no longer be right now. But he said, 'I will be in my church and this is the teaching that I entrusting to you, you have to spread the teaching.'</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If Jesus told like that, what you said, then I doubt he is in heaven or not, because I believe that he came to heaven. So, if your explanation is true, then I must check again and I have to evaluate again if he's dead on the cross. If he really told like that, it was impossible for him to go to heaven. So, if Bible has this teaching, these words, then it means it insults Jesus, and this is not something that somebody who has a sound spirit can speak. If I make just the gist of what are in the Bible, what Jesus told, then Jesus was not like that man. He was killed by people because he tried to practice the true love. From my point of view, because Jesus tried to reveal what was, at that time, in reality, that's why the spirits (gods) afraid of him. So, they killed Jesus by using the hand of living people. The difference between Jesus and Mother Theresa was that Jesus tried to practice true love, but Mother Theresa practiced a false (fake) love. If Mother Theresa could practice the real (true) love, then there's few people around her, and nobody really wanted to help. Twenty years ago, I heard the name of Mother Theresa, so I visited India, and I stopped in Calcutta. I asked to journalists there, "Who do you have who you can recommend to me in India." Most of them recommended Mother Theresa. So I visited her house (church) and the orphan house was very poor, and there were several tens of orphans, several tens of disabled children, and some nuns (many nuns). She appealed to all the world using the orphans and disabled, "Please help this orphan&hellip;." As the result, she could get huge donations every year, and that gave her fame and made her very famous, and she became the object of longing. But in fact, she spent less than 1% of all donations for the poor and sick in India. When we evaluate on the result, then the love she practiced was false. She practiced only fake love, and she could get fame and wealth, and she could ride on first class, and she could stay in a five-star hotel. It was for her desires. Not everyone can do what she did. For that, somebody needs the nature (they should be born like that). This is the real reason that she became very famous. If somebody really do something good, mass media doesn't deal with them. Where is the better things to reveal the world? When somebody reveals the world, people can protect themselves from deceiving and they can live on the right way. But at this moment, religion uses Jesus. When you say "truth", it means that there is a way in the problem. I haven't found any religion that has the way and truthful teaching. I am traveling to find out somebody who is like Jesus.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C: </strong>What language is he speaking?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Korean.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Korean. We have a Thai priest study Korean, working in Korea for about nine years. Now he is in America, he will be back here in January. He knows Korean real well. He should be back here by the middle of January. You can talk directly in Korean to him. We have one more priest, he also in Korea for about 6-7 years. He helping, preaching in Korean language, but he also help the Thai people that working in Korea that have difficulties like with employers, employees, and helping them. So, he's the same priest like me, but he's working in Korea. First of all, you ask me a question, I'm not trying to convert you, but I explain what I believe, what I, you know, my basic &ndash; my life. I can be a businessman, I can be a teacher, I can be famous in different areas, but I strongly believe in Jesus Christ, that's why I choose to be a priest. About Mother Theresa, many people say different things. Time proves itself, okay, so let the course of history prove that she's fake, phony, or she's real. I don't want to discuss about the life of Mother Theresa, but I knew her sister that's working in Nong Bua Lamphu, I know for life because how they visit the poor, the sick&hellip; they do not reveal who donates money at that time. But the money is from the people, for helping people in that area. So I know for a fact that they do not get a lot of money from America, from different places, they get the money from the people in the village. Okay, this one sick person stay at home, and people come and help. So the sisters come, dress up their wounds, give them medicine, and give direction what they gonna do. Okay, this I see for a fact. I didn't know Mother Theresa, but I know about her teaching. Every time she take care of the poor, she didn't see the sick, she saw Jesus Christ in those persons. When she received Holy Communion, she didn't see Jesus Christ, she see the face of the poor people that she's serving. So, I believe that. One last point that I want to make, that Jesus Christ is real for me because he suffered so much. Why did you kill him? Two things. They didn't expect him to be the leader. They thought that the leader had to be from a royal family, to be king, to be emperor, okay, so they disappointed. Second, his teaching is not the same old style like the Jews practiced before. He put life in people. You're not telling this, you don't do this, you don't do that, he said, "Do it. Explain to the people why you did it." So, he practicing and tell the people of the reason. So his teaching is different from the past. And "Listen, I am the son of God. I have the power to forgive the sin. I have the power to heal you. When you are crippled, you walk. When you are blind, you can see." And when he died, he said, "In three days, I will prove to you I am truly God." When he rose up, he appeared to different people. You know, the door shut like this, he walked through, and he explained, "I am, I'm here. If you persevere in my teaching, one day you will be like me." He had a mystical body, that you don't need space and time but you can do things. And then he said, "I will go, I will prepare the place for you. So all of you will be with me one day." And many people said, "Well, I ate with you, I listened to your talk, I do this, and you among us." Jesus Christ said, "No, I don't know you. Because you pick and choose. You choose to do things when it pleases you. When in time of difficulties, you abandoned me, you didn't know me." So for those people that do not practice consistently, and the word they use is persevere, that means from the beginning until the end, the same basic, the same practice. Yes, we're human beings, we struggle, we have faults, we have selfishness, we commit sins, we have anger, we are greedy, and lazy, but if we realize that we change, we change, we change. So, when you're talking about the saints, you know, are they holy? Many of them are sinners. But they changed their life, and they do better. Saint Paul, one of the closest apostles of Christ, before he arrested so many people because they believed in Jesus Christ and the teaching, or the practicing, is different from the Jews. And Jesus Christ appealed to him, "Why? Why do you persecute me, why do you arrest the Christians?" And Paul asked him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am Jesus Christ. You persecute me." And for three years, Saint Paul studied the life of Christ, and now he preaching about Jesus Christ, different from the Jews in the past. Saint Paul is one of the leading Pharisees, leading the Jews in the past. But he changed his life because he believed in the teaching of Christ. So many Saints are sinners, many saints are lepers, many saints are, you know, people in the past they can be king, emperor, they can be farmers, they can be widows, they can be anybody. They can be your father, your mother, my father, my brother, but if they die and they believe in Christ, they are saints, because they believe that, they are in heaven with God. So, what I try to share with you is, I'm not fighting against you, but you asked me a question, I explain to you my belief, my philosophy of life, what I believe in, and then I practice what I am practicing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*After Soyun translates, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He says about the revival, even though ordinary people, you know, but if they have a level of will power, then they can show themselves after death. They can just through a wall and they can show their appearance to living people. But, it's impossible to the dead with real body.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I will believe because he show his appearance after three days. When I see Jesus through religion, then Jesus is a man in mystery. I never, never understand him as a bad man. But, if I see Jesus according to your words, then Jesus seems very dangerous man. So what we need now is that you revive Jesus not kill him. But, your preaching is to kill Jesus twice. When we speak "God" then we should converse with very correct definition of the word. Otherwise, we have misunderstanding and it's confusing. I told you before if somebody has only one spirit (soul), they never tell about God &ndash; they never make God stand. But when somebody has dead spirits in them, then the dead spirit always uses the name of God because they want to use (take advantage from) the living people's body. As you said, if Jesus made God stand, it means that Jesus had the dead spirit in him. And if he had the dead spirit in him, he had the same quality (similar quality) with the leader of Judaism, so in this case, he cannot be killed by them. If you ask me, "How do you know this fact?" then I can answer like this, "In mathematics, the answer is fixed, and the answer is in question, and the world is also decided." So we can only find the way only through the problems, and in the universe there are too many objects that we can designate as God. So there's only difference how many &ndash; 10 million, billion, 20 billion&hellip;. Because of your wrong teaching, you make people who seeking for Jesus receive Holy Spirit. But this thing must be revealed very correctly. We have two kinds &ndash; body, and consciousness, and the body is the tool of consciousness, and consciousness always use own body and conscious performs what it wants by using body. In comparison, our consciousness is a car driver, and body is car. When the Holy Spirit enter to one's body, it means that there are two drivers in one body. When one drive, then the other one have a rest. There are in many, many cases, the spirit comes from outside, push out the original driver. In this case, one's own spirit (soul) doesn't act so the lacking of activities of the real soul (original soul) can't grow up and become done. So when somebody receives Holy Spirit, it means that serve for some dead people not for self. So this is for dead people, not the teaching for the living people. So I was very surprised when I found this fact. I can't distinguish this case: is this the Saint's action (behavior), or the ignorant's behavior? Because someone gives oneself to the other's soul and one's own soul is done. So is this the result of the holy mind or the ignorant? You seems nice person. So please, a person like you work on behalf of Jesus. This world is falling in extreme crisis. As the time of the world, very, very soon, this generation will face with the end, and the main powers that push the human world to the end are religions and universities. Unless religion and universities change, this humankind (human world) will have the end. So you shouldn't ridicule my words. I am a man who can see this world. If you test me, I can verify all the ways in the world of result through questions. Teaching of truth must be verified only by questions and problems. Teaching without certain questions is just cheating people. If you request me today I can tell you where is the way (where can you find the way) that you are looking for. If I give you wrong words, whenever, I'll take all the responsibility of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> That's why when he came to see me, I said I would like to give you some books to read so we have questions and discuss about it, and he said we read so many books already. So, when we ask questions to learn, we have to have common ground, so we can communicate. That's why I said I can give you the books so you can read and have questions to know about to the faith I believe in. You remember in the beginning when we were in the room over there?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I remember&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> So that's why I said, you know, human we have searching for truth and for knowledge, okay, we have to use our brain, otherwise we become static, you know, stay put. We have to search, we have to ask questions, I agree that we have to ask questions, we have to learn, we have to know more. That's why there are so many means of learning. You can read books, you can talk, you can watch television or the news, but we have to learn everyday. We will not get satisfied with what we have, but how we put into practice what we believe in. That's the thing. I'm not disagree with him, I did not challenge him, but what I'm telling him is that we have to have some common ground, some common knowledge so we can discuss things. If we do not, then we can't go anywhere. So that's why when he said he would like to know more about Catholic faith, normally what we do is that you have a booklet or something as a common ground so we can talk, we can discuss. That's all I would like to say.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You've already been here for 30 years, and I know you've read so many books and changed yourself a lot. I've seen you already. Then, what is the use to read books? I could know everything in the book through you. But the books that you've read don't have anyone that is beneficial for human life. And proof, I can have game with you, if we bet about our talking. I own about 40 million baht. I can bet 10 million for a game. You only bet 1,000 baht. Let's make a loser and a winner. When I ask you 100 questions, if you give me one right answer, you are winner. In return, you give me 100 questions, if I have only one wrong answer, then I'm loser. It doesn't matter, you have another priest and discuss with them about 100 questions. So, if you make 10 in a group, then only 100 baht each. I would like to start this game this afternoon directly. Then, maybe I can take your money 800 baht. Tomorrow, I'll have less. If you want, then I'll make a call to London and transfer my money here. How about you? Do you have any intention for this game?</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> You already do not understand about my life. I am religious, I am a priest, and we have three vows. Poverty, obedience, and chastity. Chastity, that means I am single all my life. I cannot have any family, no girlfriends&hellip;. Second, obedience. That means I have a boss. I am a pastor here but I have someone higher. So if the person change me here and there then I have to go. I cannot stay here forever. I cannot pick and choose what I like. The other one is poverty. When I use the money, I have to ask someone. I do not have money of my own. If I get the money, I have to put in commons so people can use that too. So&hellip; I lost the bet already because I have no money. I have to obey and you know, so I have no freedom to practice, you know, betting, or questions, and that type. But you are so generous. Okay? And I thank you so much for it. It's very nice to talk to you and you share your thought and you ask questions, I try because we are in limited times, so I share with you what I believe. I cannot impose on you, 'you have to believe'&hellip; So, thank you so much, because I have to have lunch and after that I have the function in the church. So I'm sorry that we didn't know ahead of time so we can schedule, we can talk, but thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I was very pleased to meet you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> If I got 40 million, I don't know what to do with the money.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Priest laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If I meet Jesus, I'll give to him.</p>

<p style=""><strong>C:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>
