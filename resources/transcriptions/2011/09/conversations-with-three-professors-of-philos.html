<h3>Conversations with three professors of philosophy and religion</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Professor 1: </strong>&hellip; Where are you now?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>*a moment passes as the professor speaks on the phone*</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Tathagata (quietly):</strong> Today is quite successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> Nobody recognizes the principle of the world like the formula in mathematics.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Okay&hellip; Yes okay. I got a call from a professor, and someone who is Christian.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>*Tathagata says something in Korean*</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Ah&ndash; what ?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Okay I'll translate</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> I am traveling around the world to find the future of human societies. I visit every country in the world and I confirm (check) the problems of the reality in the present. I mainly contact the people who work in the parts of religion, education, and science. So I visited lots of universities and institutes. That's why I came to Thailand this time. I've met so many people in this country so far. But I didn't have any harvest from them.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Any&hellip;?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Harvest.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Oh, harvest. I see.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> That's why I am in anguish.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Oh, okay&hellip;.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>Somebody listened to our circumstance and she introduced us this university. She said that you have very expensive school fee, and of course you have so good professors in this university. So, that's why, today we came here. I've visited more than 42 countries so far. Every countries I visited I met many excellent people.&hellip; maybe they are people introduced us that they are excellent.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>Heh&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> But, I didn't have opportunities to converse to talk to them with satisfaction. I don't know why, but whenever I give questions to them, most of them are silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Ah.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>Or, if I don't give any questions to them, how I can check the problems in reality? I met so many professors around the world but I had only one philosopher who wanted to listen to me. When I visited Hungary, three main newspapers in Hungary recommended him to me. His name is Boid.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Spelling? B-E&hellip;?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>Boid&hellip; spelling? Spelling&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>Boid.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Boid. B-O-I-D.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Oh, oh, B-O-I-D&hellip;. Boid, Boid.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> And he also was a professor in Free University in Germany. He spoke very sweetly and very fluently. So I asked him, "What do you know about what parts?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> What about&hellip;?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> About what part?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Satto: </strong>"Part." "What do you know about what part?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Of what department.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Of what department.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Satto: </strong>About what matter.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Oh, "what matter". Oh. Oh&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>And he answered to me that, "Oh, I don't know anything." So I told him like this, "People don't know that they don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah&hellip; haha&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>But at least you know that you don't know anything." So he requested us that, "When I have a hard problem, can I ask you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>So he said "Yes, you can." , so he has his address and name card&hellip;.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>To become a philosopher, they need purity in mind. But, the present philosophers lost their purity in spirit. They don't try to see the world of philosophy by the principle and the problems. But they always make the logic. That's why they transformed philosophy. When we have correct understanding of philosophy, then it's very easy to teach and easy to learn and very easy to use them practically. You surely have learned and taught philosophy for a long time. You may be embarrassed if I give you a very basic question.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah, no problem. Yeah.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> No problem? Heh</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> But that's not your fault. If somebody has seen an elephant, they will be able to recognize when they see elephant again. And they will be able to explain what the elephant is like so that they can verify what they saw. Then, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a very basic question. In case if you can't answer to me, then don't hate us&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>*people begin to laugh*</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> It will be very, very important chance for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> First of all, you've learned philosophy, you teach philosophy. Could you tell me the definition of philosophy? (When you say philosophy, what do you designate?) If you learned the philosophy from somebody who knows philosophy, then you know this answer immediately. But, if you learn from somebody who doesn't know philosophy, then this answer will be very difficult.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>*Tathagata chuckles*</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> But first of all&hellip; I would like to ask you first, do you want any coffee?&nbsp; Coffee?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Do you want 'awantin'? Awantin? Or something? Awantin? We have awantin. Awantin. Awantin.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Satto:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Yes. Back inside there is a restroom, also.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Satto: </strong>Ah, thank you.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>*It sounds like the professor leaves*</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>Satto. There's nothing wrong in my speech. When they teach an elephant, they should explain the elephant that they saw. If they can't explain what elephant is like, then they never saw elephant before. Can you understand why I told you you will be the best teacher in Europe if you attend with me for two years' travel together? Because you saw this&hellip; it's possible for you to be the best in the world. My question to him is the same as number one in mathematics (figure #1). It's the starting point. If they don't recognize the number one, they don't know number one hundred. If you collect all the doctors and masters in the same place, they must be silent after my three questions. Maybe they will be silent with my first question&hellip; and I can answer all of their questions. That's the only difference between me and them. That's why I have so hard time like this. You could know from my message how did I grow up. I never caused any damage to others and never told lie. So I can make _____ [Editor's note: Couldn't confirm I understood this word for sure. Might be "promises" @ 19:20] with anybody and I can be very _______ [Might be "diligent"].&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> So what does your society do there ?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> They study the problems of human society. That's why we are traveling every countries in the world. And this time, we are visiting Thailand. So, I would like to listen your opinion. It will be very important part in the political philosophy. About 500 years ago, Japan had a very bad environment for living of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Satto:</strong> Yes, thank you. This is mailo.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>Mm..</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> The Japanese society was divided with various tribes and various powers, and it was very difficult for people to make their living at the time. And for survival in that situation, there were many soldiers at that time. That's why they invaded the neighboring countries and they deprived wealth. But, in the point of 500 years, Japan's society became to be stable. And they continue the stable situation until now from 500 years ago. If you know, please tell me how could this foundation of Japan's society make this? (Do you have any idea about this?)</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2: </strong>You want the foundation of the Japanese society which has made progress&hellip;?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, from 500 years ago&hellip; So far.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> I see&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; do you know the reason of the foundation, the basic reason&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> I guess it should be the exploitation of technology, probably, the way that they have put technology to good use. And also, you know, Japan as a society cannot be possible unless it is industrialized. And Japan has to depend entirely on the market economy, because Japan is a small nation, with a bunch of islands, they have hardly any resources, their natural resources are very limited. Therefore they're forced to import raw materials from the rest of the world and convert the raw materials into finished goods, products, and sell them all over the world. That's the only way Japan can survive. And so they're exploiting this and they have also made good use of western technology. And&hellip; I think without the technology and industrialization, Japan would collapse as an economic power.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> My question is that how that kind of things could happen. What is the basic reason for all those phenomena?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> I think it has much to do with the Japanese character&hellip; Japanese character, their sense of discipline, and loyalty, they are very loyal to the company where they go. And also they've done hard work, and there's the desire to excel, and the desire for excellence. So I think these are certain Japanese characteristics which have also caused them to enlarge to their greatness.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> All the creatures can be changed by the influence of circumstance and environment. The point of my question is that how their change was possible, and when for their characters. Five hundred years ago, they didn't have any technology and the nation's character was not like that&hellip; and they even couldn't trust each other. They were all divided. This model is the best one when you teach political philosophy. That's why I gave this question to you. Do you want to know about the change in Japanese society?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> I would like to know why you have chosen Japan as a model. Why are we talking about Japan?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> Because the model of Japan can be the best philosophy in our reality now. The reason that many of societies have suffering and chaos, and poverty, is that they lack of philosophy and social problems (political problems). That's why I gave the question to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> Yeah, but at the same time&hellip; in spite of the great progress Japan has made, can Japan escape the nuclear explosion?</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> Today that is the greatest problem facing all of us. Where is the problem about land if we are going to have a nuclear explosion? I think there will be a nuclear explosion because we all have nuclear weapons, and the purpose is their use. Weapons are for use, not for admiring or for us talking, but the weapons are for use, and while they are there, they'll be used now. And what will be the circumstance if a nuclear explosion or a nuclear holocaust, and in that case what will happen to Japan's progress? Where does it lead to finally?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> When somebody uses the nuclear weapon, then only the area that are attacked by the weapon will be destroyed. I'd like to ask you&hellip; if you meet somebody who is better than you, and when you find some questions that you cannot answer, then will you hostile to him because you think you are insulted? Or, you will be appreciative to him because you have a chance to awaken?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2: </strong>Of course, I will certainly appreciate this person, there's no reason to be hostile towards the fellow human being&hellip; It's a pleasure to meet another person.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P2:</strong> So it goes what the other person may have, they're very different you from and mine, still then I can learn from the other person many things. And I do not have answers to all the questions.&nbsp;</p>

If you give me questions then I will be able to answer and I can verify as far as I know. In order to know what kind of part we can discuss, I would like to give you a couple of questions before our discussion. People in the past called the universities as the place for truth.

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3:</strong> This teaching, for me, is not that the other ways are true, but this one is for me.

So your answer was just like what I had said before. The second question is that, among the teachings of Jesus, what can you recommend to us to receive for human world? (What teaching could you recommend?)</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3:</strong> Love is the power, it's guiding&hellip; it's not the word, but it's the feeling it's something concrete, it's something we can touch, it's something that is needed not just to be loved by yourself but love the other. It's something that makes me happy. It's something that makes you know what is the meaning of life, it's love.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>All the consequences are created by problems. So when I ask something to you, you should tell me the problem (the question) where does the consequence stay. I gave you two questions, but you gave me two answers without any matters. If you don't have any matters, then you can't verify your truth, and nobody can recognize the truth in the matters. Good teachings always must be in problems. So if my words are wrong then you can tell me what point is wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> is that because the main power (the main bodies) of societies are produced from universities, and religion influences very much to the reality of the society.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>I can agree to the point that university is the body of knowledge that can solve all the problems of the human society. To me, I think the family, I do agree with her that love is everything. Love can solve all the problems of human beings, because human beings is actually spiritual being. Human beings, you know, it's not like animal, a human being is, we can say, a rational being. Therefore, one thing man can feel is love. In the family, family is where it's possible for the problems, it's the first status in human life. Family&hellip; as a husband, I have to love my wife as family. As a father, I have to love my children &ndash; the way I love, I have to teach them to be good, first. That is the first university in our life, in our human life. That is the truth, then. We can see, we can perceive, at first, okay, next university. The university, yes, will be the body of knowledge that can solve the problem, but it depends on you. In case you choose philosophy or religion, we can help you. If you choose economics, you choose politics, this may be a problem, see? Therefore what we are doing is the philosophy of love, philosophy of truth&hellip;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> All the creatures are influenced by environment. If we don't have good society, nobody can guarantee to be happy. When I visited this country before about thirteen or fourteen years before, I met Praya Seong Bon who is the Supreme Patriarch of this country, and he asked me about love. So I answered to him like this. Listen to my answer here, and think about that. "I teach the conscience and justice for people in the world. Because the conscience is the way to brighten our mind and the justice is the way to brighten the society. So if people can live with bright mind in the bright society, then that is the best blessing. So I will act to deliver this blessing to people, and this kind of teaching can apply to any kind of people. And in human society, these teachings can be the best blessing for the human world." He was very old, but he detained me for 5 hours and he enjoyed very much talking with me.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Can I say about your ideas, about conscience, and also justice, see conscience and justice, yes they will be useful for the humankind and brighten society, but in regards to justice, this also is the problematic word. The word itself signifies something that cannot be agreed upon. The reason for justice, you know&hellip; Iraq's people say they are right. American people say they are right. What is justice according to them? They would define justice in different ways. Therefore, in order to, I would like to mention, the Pope the word, the saying of the present Pope, the present pope say that "There will be no peace without justice." Justice is necessary for the peace. And no justice without forgiveness</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S: </strong>Without forgiveness</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1: </strong>Forgiveness is necessary, forgiveness is a kind of love. Therefore, if you love, love and justice must go together. Sometimes you cannot just ask for the justice if you don't know how to forgive. Because, we are living together in a society sometimes, we might have done something wrong, something wrong to others because of intentions. But we forgive. Sometimes we have to forgive. And start a new life again, to re-friend each others. Forgiveness, or love, is necessary, as well as justice with the conscience or mindfulness. I think man can love as necessary but not only justice. Haha&hellip;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> The Catholic Pope is just ordinary person, and he can use the word of justice but he doesn't know how we can achieve justice. Of course, he can use the word love, but he doesn't understand what kind of matters can accomplish love. So, if I tell you one truth now, then I bet my life. I can meet the Pope, and when I meet him, I can give him 1,000 questions about what he is doing. If he can know what consequences come from his activities, if he can answer 3 answers to my 1,000 questions, then I'll give my life to him.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> Truth must be verified with the process and if they tell the truth they should verify what are in the results. If we expect good thing then good thing must stay in the result. And the bad thing will come when it comes from the result. You mentioned about Saddam Hussein. Just Saddam Hussein was ignorant, so he couldn't keep his position. And American doesn't have enough wisdom, that's why they can't arrange the chaos there. If I were Saddam Hussein, I would never lost my position.&nbsp;</p>

Because, all the answers lies in the questions (in the problems). If we don't recognize the questions (the problems), then we do something wrong always. Do you know why I meet you? Because philosophy can change people's thought, and humankind had influence to make good society or bad society. That's why the most important essence of learning and teaching philosophy is that to know what philosophy is. If people learn or teach philosophy without learning that exactly, it makes problems.&nbsp;</p>

There will be so many ways, so many answers, normally one answer is correct, but so many answers. You may say truth as justice. I may say truth as love. &hellip; Therefore, you may like justice, I may like love. Through love, I can pacify myself and psyche. Through justice, you can pacify the world. Therefore we can say your philosophy is justice as possible answer for you. My philosophy is love, it's a possible answer for me. Therefore, philosophy is only possible answers. It depends on who, it depends on me to choose.&nbsp; I chose love, you chose justice, this is like a food&hellip; I have my coffee, you may like mailo&hellip; mailo&hellip; coffee&hellip; This is philosophy.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world exists by one principle, and here, everything has different phenomena, and it is decided by their own questions (their own problems). I never speak my idea or abstract things. I always answer on the questions by this principle. Whenever you find the point that you disagree, please let me know. The ancient people said the university is the place of the truth. The reason is that because they expected that people can learn philosophy in university. And philosophy stays in every department, and people can make themselves realize by the real philosophy. So please think what people can learn through philosophy you teach now. Several years ago, I visited the secretary room of the Pope in Poland. His office was in ______ [Editor's note: Couldn't understand this or find via search&hellip; @1:14:01] and the office was in the priests' house. Because I listened that there are many priests and nuns who could speak English, so I visited there and I could talk to principal of the dormitory, and she understood very well what I talk. So I asked her, "Did you become to be nun because of poverty?" She said, "No." In Poland, the Germany people have the Catholic religion, and her family was the Catholic. That's why she became a nun. So I told her my truth, because she seemed a little bit different from the normal people. Because this world exists by such a principle, and same thing always repeats periodically in this world. In this human world, we have the word of the "end" of the world for a long, long time,&nbsp; and this means actually the human world is in very great danger now. So I told her, "People who have religion cannot be saved in the end of the world." When she listened to me, she said that she wants to live for herself. I told her, "It may be make god a _______ [Editor's note: Couldn't understand this word for certain after multiple listens&hellip;. could be "king" or "kid" or "killed"&hellip; @1:17:50]. No saints (no gods) want the human kind to become miserable." Right teaching (good teaching) make people awaken spiritually and help them change better. But, wrong teaching harm people who fall into darkness and harm them worse. If religion doesn't depend on the teachings instead they make God stand, then the result is that not for living people but for the dead people. I never interfere with what religious people do. When you recommend people to join or enter the specific religion, then they should reveal first what are in that religion and inform them correctly what is the result of doing that religion and after that, you should give chance of choice for them. But, the current religions don't do like this. Do you know how can I speak very confidently that people who have religion cannot be saved? Everything in this world that exists can exist again by their own activities. If we analyze the human beings, then we can say in two ways. One is physical body, one is spirit. Humans' body is composed by materials, but the main body of spirit is our consciousness, and consciousness is composed by what we have done. So unless are consciousness are awakened spiritually, and if our consciousness don't receive something good, then we cannot expect to solve. I taught people like this, "Religion without teaching is for dead people." But, if they say, "We have teaching in our religion." then they must reveal their teaching is beneficial for human world or not. If a mathematical teacher teaches mathematics without questions, it makes new problems. In current religions, I cannot find any religion that they have teaching that result good result. I can perceive everything in the world. So if you have something to know, please give me your questions. Then I could answer. If you want to know very concretely, then you should ask me very concrete way again and again until you understand. Otherwise, even though you listen to me, you don't have perfect understanding. If I don't have this ability, how can I visit all the intellectuals in the world and I request talking and 'give me your questions' alone (I am alone.) ?</p>

But we need also the person to care for society, to have responsibility for society. Then we have discussion.

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3:</strong> Because in Thailand for almost 100 years we try to follow the model of western education. Really like that&hellip; We teach the students to become professionals, for work, for job. We really teach them how to be a human life &ndash; our human being. It's not like before in Eastern philosophy of China, they teach how to become human being. They told me I must ask my spirit 'What are human being?' They say they don't know. Their body &ndash; they just know they have a body of a human, they do not know they have also soul &ndash; spirit. Now we recognize that we cannot all of that. Finally, we try to teach the student about our ethics, or morals, or the ground of the Thai country, or various religions for the graduate students all over Thailand now. And many professors told that in Thailand we are afraid of the Western countries</p>

If you know my truths of myself, then you will be very surprised. About 60-70 years ago, Korea was the colony, and I was born in colonial society.

And we had to survive, that's why my mother every day went out for work, left me alone in the empty house. When I became 9 years old, my mother passed away. So I never had any others' assistance, and I've never been educated by others. But, I am confident that my knowledge is better than all the knowledge of all the doctors in this world. Every intellectuals have to silent if I ask them three questions consciously. But, actually, they will be silent to my first question. And I will answer to their questions exactly the correct answer according to the principle and the problem. It is possible for someone who has this ability only when they are not polluted by falsehoods.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>when he came here, I asked him because I didn't have any idea what kind of topics are available of discussion with him. He said that his major is social philosophy including political philosophy. That's why I mentioned about Japanese philosophy and Japanese history. Because this topic is very, very important for the educator in this age. Because there are so many poor countries in this world and there are so many people who are suffered from starvations. The cause of their suffering comes from the individual ignorance and wrong politics. I had the same topics like this in India many years ago. When I visited New Delhi, the capital city in India, I had invitation from the Vice Chancellor of Nehru University. His name was Dr. Agwani (the president) and his first question was that, "Could you tell me the future of India?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong>&nbsp; So I told him, "Unless the consciousness of Indians change, then the problems of India will be continued." Then he asked to me, "Then the person like you live in Korea, then why your country has such problems?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">"In this world, there are so many ignorant people. So, Korea's same. In Korea, there are also so many ignorant people. That's why they create all the problems."</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T (laughing):</strong> "Then, how are you received by Korean people?" So I answered that, "Oh, I am not well received even my wife."</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> When I listened to my this question, he became more polite. He said, "I believe that you are honest people." So, whenever I visit India, we had time to meet and talk.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">We also traveled Pune. Pune is the city of education. We had invitation from the vice chancellor of Pune University. When the president met us, he gave me this question. "Could you tell me where my soul is?" I answered, "Before I tell you the answer, I would like to confirm could you understand what I speak or not." He was a very famous philosopher in India, his name is Mr. Gupte.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P1:</strong> Mm, Gupte, yes&hellip;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> So, before I give the answer to his question, I asked him this, "Where did a bean pea come from?" This question seems very easy, but answers are different depends on individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">He answered to this, "Is it right that bean from bean?" When I listened his question, then I decided that I could answer to his question. "That's right. A bean came from a bean. But, suppose if I ask to bean tree, 'Where did you come from?' Then the bean tree answer, 'I came from the soil (the ground).' So people can't answer in a different way from their different view. Your soul stays inside you, and your soul will bear the fruit by what you have done. The bean sprout the bud, and the bud grow up, it open flowers and bear fruit. And the fruit become a seed and it sprouts again and grow up new plant.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> So your soul is made (is grown) by what are inside you and when you die, you will revive through your soul. Good yourself or bad yourself will be made by what are in you." When he listened to my answer, he was very impressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">"Many people around me are trying to know this, but nobody could explain like you." So he said, "I have very good time to understand myself." And he organized a meeting with the professors and he introduced the new president after his retirement.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> The important thing is that education must produce the human's purity. So I never say, "You do something bad." If you do something wrong, or if you think something wrong, the reason is that you've learned like that. That's why teaching is very important. I never say to any kind of religious people that what you do is right or wrong (I don't mention like that). Because the best way is that they should realize by themselves. So if somebody tell them, 'Oh, you are not right.' then they hurt. I'd like to tell you what I've seen. The result that you believed in God, believed in Jesus, is that only you receive Holy Spirit. But the only problem is that you don't know exactly what is the true nature who are the Holy Spirit (who is the Holy Spirit). So it will be very hard to recover you without depart the Holy Spirit inside you. But, if you keep the Holy Spirit inside you, then it will influence to your decision. That's the problem. If you could have met us earlier then you could do something great for yourself and others. In Christianity, if I ask them, "Who is God?" they say, "It is Creator." But, the Creator never contact human society. No matter how hard you pray to it, it never influence to human life.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> You should know this fact. Any kind of consciousness find it impossible to contact the Creator. That's true, Jesus Christ was a good teacher. But I am <em>very</em> sorry for this fact that the Christianity doesn't have the teaching of Christ. This is the misery of the real Christian (of the real true Christians). If you more devote for that religion then you will have more chance to become servant of the dead spirits. So I don't tell you that's the great thing or not. But, you kill your own soul for the dead spirits.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T: </strong>Of course, the ministers or fathers can have assistance of the dead spirits from their activities. That's why they can enjoy their lives very easily without doing some hard work. But they must pay very much. If you are true Christian, you should seek for the real Jesus' teaching. But it will be difficult for your ability to find out what was real Jesus' teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3: </strong>Yes it true that before that, just seeker. Everyone also seeker. Every day I try to seek and try to listen to the Holy Spirit, and then every day I try to tell myself, like this 'You are nothing. You are everything. I'm nothing. You are everything.' and that's why for me, how I see you, God? How I can see you, Jesus? And I cannot see you. But I can see him through people, through moon, through sun, they also my brother and sister. Sometime it's more difficult. But then I have experience. And experience is the most vital thing. That&hellip; for me. I read Bible, I read many book about religion, but that's only knowledge. But for me to have the experience is invaluable in life. Together with conscience, this one is, I think, I will be very experienced. I experience and then the other thing, that comes</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> You want experience&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3:</strong> This one is very beneficial by the evidence from also make me, how you say&hellip; that I really exist because of my experience. Not just only knowledge outside and I'm living, my action is inside my mind.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> You already have the Holy Spirit in you, but the Holy Spirit doesn't seem to give you very bad influence. But in some cases, it can influence you badly. It's useless for us to depend on our thinking without knowing the fact. Prayer can give us consolation, but it can't solve the problems in our reality. You see, there are two lands, one is occupied by farmer, one is occupied by minister of church, then the result of harvest is better of the farmers. No matter how hard you plead to God or Jesus, "Please farm our land", it's useless. If people want to have good harvest, they need to know the way of cultivation and what are in the process of farming.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">You are learning, so you probably can understand what I say even a little bit, and you may probably understand me even a little because you've experienced many. When you listen to me, my words seems abstract, but when I listen to you, then I feel quite stuffy. I feel stuffy because when you speak something, then you don't have any certain matter. And the reason that you can't receive my words as they really are is that you cannot recognize the questions in what I speak, and this difference between you and me cannot be overcome easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">I can give you everything that you need. How about you? Do you have wish to be a Christ for Thailand people? Then I give you all of my wisdom. This is a worthy dream that anyone can have once. If you can find anybody who is superior to my wisdom then you can take my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">If you devoted for a long time as a Christian, then first of all, I would like to tell you about what did Jesus want to do. Don't think that Jesus was the son of God in abstract way. Jesus was a kind of teacher who was hardly met in human world. If you really want to do something for Jesus, then you should make him as the real teacher for human life. That's the real mission of the Christians.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">Are you interested in me? If you are interested in me, then you can ask the questions that you really wanted to know. If you find time to meet me (to visit me), then please if we make an appointment you can visit me, but when you come to me, you bring your ______ [2:08:48] tape. It's impossible for anybody to understand what I say after one time of listening. But, if they try to check in the reality what they've heard from the tape, then you will be able to recognize and understand what you didn't know so far. I understand how this world work with principle. Because I speak like this, please don't think me as a strange person. The things in the world repeat again and again periodically. The end of the world means one world move to next world, and at this moment, this world leaves something it must throw away. So, temporarily, all the creatures and all the civilizations will disappear. The prophets foretold this phenomenon as the end of the world. It's up to you whether you will be able to save yourself or not, and we can know immediately when the end of the world come when we calculate what happens in this world. Everything acts repeatedly like the hands of the clock.&nbsp;</p>

If we calculate this in the world time, we left only 14 years.*&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> Because everything in the world is predestined. If somebody knows the principle he can answer to <em>any</em> part in human world such as politics, science, religion, economics <span style="font: 12.0px Helvetica;">&ndash;</span> <em>all</em> of the parts. So I can talk about any part and my talking will be not wrong in the result. When I see that human beings do, I feel very stuffy because if they want to find something, they need to invite somebody who know that. So, no matter how long time they discuss, but if members, all of them, they don't know, then it's just waste time &ndash; they can't find the way at all. You are good person, but you wasted many hours (long time). From now on, you'd better that you become the Christ instead only believe in Christ. It is the way to save yourself and help others. So if somebody asks you some questions, then you just say, "I don't know" when you don't know. That's the best answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3: </strong>Thank you very much. I appreciate the talk, because though your talk is different for me, it's not make me, how you say, waste time. The difference between us is the gift of knowledge. Not just give knowledge but for life.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> I never speak my own thoughts. I only speak when I see the result that produced by the questions, and all my words are true. That's why I can speak about all the teachings and I can perceive very easily any kind of the world. This moment you met me will be the best memory in your life. So don't ignore this moment that you had the best academic career but you had to listen to a man who didn't even graduate the primary school.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> But you need to know this fact. The real genius is born from oneself.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> He's not educated by others.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> Even though you learn for ten thousand years from human beings, then you can't be over (beyond) the level of human beings.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3:</strong> I agree. But we are indebted to beyond because I believe, in religion, all wisdom of all things that you receive maybe from the world, from above the world. Like the monks in Thailand when they live in the forest to cultivate the divine. I mean you get it in the world like that. There's some people who have wisdom. Then many indebted come to listen to them for teaching like that, about wisdom for the world. I agree about educated people because they have knowledge without indebted people like in the forest. But how come they have the wisdom from beyond? Many people came to receive the wisdom&hellip; because they received something from beyond &ndash; from divine. I cannot that God, or the divine give them, but "grace".</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> That's not true&hellip; Even though they have the highest academic career, but they are still ignorant. That's why they are deceived by them. It's like the same that you could receive the other spirit (Holy Spirit) through your praying. But, the monks could receive the dead spirits through practicing meditation. When they receive the dead spirits, they become to speak very fluently even though they don't know what they speak. But, because people don't recognize what the question or problem is, that's why they are easily deceived by their words.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">For one month in Thailand, I've met so many monks but I've never found anyone who could tell me one truth. So actually, the monks, ministers, priests, are worse than you. When you observe their reality, we find that they had some problem to cope with their social life so they escaped to religion. If, for example, their nature is apple, and they plant to religious soil, they can't change themselves to mango. All the seeds revive their origin finally. In the same principle, if somebody becomes religious person, it doesn't mean the stupid people change to excellent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">One benefit to become religious people is that they always preach something for people, but if they have some problem in their speech, then if they can't take responsibility about what they spoke, then they only use the Buddha if they are monk, or Jesus if they're Christian.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>S:</strong> Did you understand what I said...?</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>P3</strong>: Yes</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> So, it's very easy for people to be deceived by them. They don't doubt about what they speak. Before you become to be a Buddha or to be a Jesus by yourself, some being you expect doesn't appear in front of you. So you know, when Jesus was enlightened and he started to save people, then he seemed nothing at the time. When he was killed, who was beside him? Maria Magdalena was a kind of prostitute, and only his mother, Maria. Besides of two women, who stood with him? Yes, he had some disciples, but when he was in danger, they ran away.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica;"><strong>T:</strong> And among the disciples who are in very high position in society at the time. So, religion only uses the name of Jesus. If the Christianity really have Jesus' real teaching, then Christianity can't expand like this. The place that have good teaching, the Holy Spirits or ghost don't enter. If the ghosts don't work, then people don't come, people don't donate. Gautama Buddha was Enlightened perfectly, but he didn't enjoy his life well. He had to beg for survival. He had to walk when he traveled.</p>
