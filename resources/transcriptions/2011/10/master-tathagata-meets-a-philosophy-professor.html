</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>*Someone knocks*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Professor of philosophy:</strong> Hi&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Hello again!</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> We can only talk for 10 minutes. I have to go meet with my department officials at 4. But that's alright. We talk fast. In Korean, we talk fast.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata):</strong> Yes&hellip; <strong>*begins to laugh*</strong> in Korean?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay. Have a seat. So, come and sit down. Have you met my colleague?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Hi</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Hello</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Alright, so what can I do for you?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> This is Mr. Sam-Han Lee, the president of our society.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> How do you do. Do you know Young-Soo Kim? Friend of mine in Korea. Professor Kim.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Professor Kim?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> Hehehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Everybody in Korea named Professor Kim.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh, I see.. hehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Entire population named Professor Kim. I &ndash; when I was in Korea,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yea?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> They would say to me, "Oh, meet Professor Kim. Meet Professor Kim."</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Professor Kim? Hehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> "Meet Professor Kim, and this is Professor Kim"</p>

<p style=""><strong>*before translation, Tathagata laughs loudly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> They had two other names. Park.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Park?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> "Oh, Professor Kim, this is Professor Kim. Meet Professor Park"</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Park</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> And some&ndash; there was actually a guy named Lee.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Lee!&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> But everyone else in Korea named Kim.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Hehehe</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay. So, what &ndash; we have little time &ndash; so you have to ask questions fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Alright. So you have 10 minutes?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah. 8 and a half.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> 8 and half.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have been studying philosophy for a long, long time.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh, me too.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's why I have quite knowledge about philosophy.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But still, I haven't met anyone who I can converse properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Ah huh&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In order to understand <strong>*phone rings*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Hello? Ah &ndash; who? Wrong number. Okay, bye. <strong>*hangs up*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In order to understand</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Unless you're John Tanachi. No, go ahead.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In order to understand&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> the difference of our view, I would like to give you one simple question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes, please do.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In the past, philosophers had great respect from lots of people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah&hellip; not in America.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> But today, if some people say, "I am philosopher."</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then people think a little bit strange (strange people).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Ah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Could you tell me what is the difference between philosophy in past and today?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, in this respect, I don't think there is any difference. In America, people never held philosophers in great respect. They always think it's very strange if you are a philosopher.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah haha&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Most people I meet refuse to believe I am philosopher. I meet a guy in a bar or skiing, and he says, "What do you do?" and I say, "I am philosopher" they don't believe me. I go to a party and I asked people once at a party in San Francisco, "What do you think I do for a living?" and they said, "Well, you must be in sales." Or some guy said, "You must be a lawyer. Or maybe you're in advertising." Nobody ever says "you are philosopher."</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> I see</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So I don't think there's any change in America. It's always the same.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Americans think you are slightly crazy to be a philosopher because they think you don't make much money. But they are wrong. I make a lot of money.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Do you know somebody in America who knows the definition of philosophy?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh yes. In any dictionary. You can find it on&hellip; the web. You can find it on the Internet. Philosophy.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've never read any definition of philosophy in web, Internet, or dictionary.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well I'll give it to you right now. Always have morphology. Morphology. God loves morphology. 'Philo-' means wisdom. So &ndash; sorry, 'philo-' means love. 'Sophia' means wisdom. 'Philosophia' is love of wisdom.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs briefly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Such definition is not clear. If you speak like that, it's very difficult for people to see exactly. I have met&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*There's a knock at the door and some movement*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> My friends</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh, are yous guys with same party?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Come on in! We having a party.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*there's some movement as Tathagata begins to speak again*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So you guys have to stand &hellip; you can go sit down &hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*more movement and chairs being moved*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> It's okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> It's okay&hellip; don't&hellip; we have short time, so please&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> We gotta go in 5 minutes &ndash; 2 minutes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs loudly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've met so many people. I haven't met anyone who could tell me definition of love</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh really?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> when I ask them.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Ah. Why do you want a definition?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The purpose of learning is to know.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If we cannot know from learning, it's better for us not to learn.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Why? Because, you see, why do you want definitions? Definitions only tell you the meaning of words.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Because the term love contains very, very important meaning.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Only when we know what love is,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> we can live properly as human beings.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Really</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What do you think of how many people can understand (can answer) this question?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I don't know. But it doesn't matter. The important thing about knowing what love is is to be able to practice it, not to define it. The word is not what matters, it's the practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Hehe&hellip; If we don't know the meaning, it's impossible for us to practice it.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh, it's very easy to practice it. I practice it for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Haha. Without learning, how we can practice?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, let me give you another example.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> For centuries, we didn't know the meaning of life. Of what it is to be alive. But we still practice life. It wasn't until the 1950s that we began to get a scientific definition of the concept of life. So what? We still know how to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>If somebody doesn't know the meaning of love,&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then we cannot say he or she really live.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No, you're just wrong. I can tell you I have a dog who loves me, and he doesn't know the meaning of love because he's not interested in words. I'll bring him here, you can see it. And I love him, too. He's a good dog.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>You say you love dog and your dog loves you,</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then please tell us exactly the meaning that you say that love.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, it's, the meaning is the relationship that I have with my dog, and a whole lot of other things. I love Cabernet Sauvignon. Some people&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>You mean love is relationship?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There are some</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Between&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There are some loving relationships. So is hate. Hate is also a relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>But love and affection are different.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes. Yes, indeed. Very much. Yeah. And I have a love for being on time, so I have to go&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Hehe..</p>

<p style=""><strong>T (in English):</strong> Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So&hellip; Professor Lee!&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs loudly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Very nice to meet you. You're a hell of a guy! I'm sorry you're not Professor Kim.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So&hellip; who is Kim?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Member: </strong>No&hellip; Nobody is Kim.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Not here</p>

<p style=""><strong>...</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> You are Spanish, huh?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> What are you doing with these guys?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> &hellip; Learning!</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I loved talking to you!</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (laughing): </strong>I don't think so&hellip;</p>
