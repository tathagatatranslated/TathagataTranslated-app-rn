<p style=""><strong>*Both parties get settled as the meeting begins*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> Our society has established in 1984.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The Society of Natural Science</p>

<p style=""><strong>Global climate expert:</strong> Yes, yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And our society is run by small members. However, we have more informations than any other organizations in the world. Recently, we have been studying about what is the influence to the future from what happens in the present in the society. During our course, we have found very, very important matters. In order to obtain more accurate information, we have been traveling around the world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We have a principle that we can find more accurate truth than any other scientists.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And we make very close examination on the matters by this principle.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We have very few mistakes&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> of our information.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We have reported about a variety of fields but we haven't had such many mistakes on our report.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes, yes&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We are hoping that our information and knowledge will be very contributive for humankind. Even if we observe the same thing, but according to our vision (because of difference of vision), we can see on the different way.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>At the moment I cannot confirm that how our information will be helpful to you, because of this problem. In case you're interested in what I speak and try to confirm what I speak, then my information will be very helpful to your study. We know that recently the environmental problems have become a very great issue in society. But we still don't have the correct knowledge about correct cause that it occurs (the environmental problems) by scientists. Some claims from the scientifical world are quite distant from the fact itself. I'm very worried about these aspects, what's going on now in society. I am, for example, like a mathematician. I always see the matters by applying a principle. That's why it's possible for me to discuss any matters. What is your specialty? I would like to talk to you with your specialty.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Okay. Well, let me first ask a question about your concern about climate change. What concerns do you have?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>What I am most concerned is that the temperature inside of this Earth is increasing now. And today's circumstance has been predicted several thousand years ago. And the cause of the increasing temperature on the surface of this Earth is that crack in the gravity field. When the crack occurs in the gravity field, things inside of the Earth start to act. And the temperature is increasing on the surface of this Earth because of some activities inside of Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Down below</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Okay</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I believe that you have scientists here study about gravity. In fact, they are totally ignorant about the real substance of the gravity. How does gravity act to ecosystem on this Earth, and the role on ecosystem. Nobody knows how the gravity was formed. When the gravity was formed, how could it keep (preserve) itself continuously? Fourth, nobody can even imagine how the crack could happen in the gravity field (by what kind of circumstance). The crack of the gravity field caused from the breaking of balance in the ecosystem. Of course, the real cause of this circumstance is the modern civilization. Nobody can stop this (nobody can prevent). You may understand because you are the scientist ________ [Transcription note: Couldn't make out this word @13:05] to Earth science. This Earth is the mother (Motae, origin) of all the living things. This Earth, like the living creature,</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> shows response (reaction) to any change. Because of the crack of the gravity field, in core, the core of this Earth start its act. I've heard that (I would like to confirm from you), this university is the first one that created the nuclear bomb?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>Some scientists from here</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata): </strong>Maybe some scientists made the nuclear bomb in this university for the first time, is it right?</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> No, I think the nuclear weapon was built at Los Alamos.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Yeah&hellip; but some scientists from this university, maybe&hellip;?</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Well, you have to read the history of atomic science&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, no?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Hm?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>It's not true?</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> No, I think you have&ndash; it's&hellip; who was involved is&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> From this university</p>

<p style=""><strong>G: </strong>is well documented and I'm not aware of the details. It happened a long time ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> I see <strong>*translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The nuclear&hellip; when they start to act, then it increases with tremendous speed. Now, we say we have 1&deg; Celsius</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> I don't know about Fahrenheit</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Mm, yes that's right</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, we use celsius</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> 1&deg; C increase. But it doesn't make such serious problem. But, if the degree (temperature) go to 3&deg; of change, then the Earth is ready to exploded. In order to help your understanding, I would like to explain one example. We have energy in our body.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Energy has the same role of gravity on Earth.</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Our energy in our body play as the role of the immunity. If the energy becomes weaker, then we have problems in the immune system. It's very easy for human body to get the disease. Somebody is very serious if their body temperature goes up, and where our normal temperature is maybe 36.5, 36, but their temperature increase 39, until, then it becomes very dangerous. This is just like our body system. When the energy in our body cannot circulate well, then the immunity power becomes weaker. Like this, this Earth has same system just like our body. At the moment, mankind faces a very, very serious condition now. But nobody really wants to know the truth of this circumstance. And this society is _______ [@19:50] by the very abstract rumors and claims by the idealists. Many people who concern about the environment, they always claim something, but their higher voice is not helpful to solve this problem (environmentalists). When the crack of gravity occurs, the first symptom is the temperature increasing on this Earth. Secondly, air temperature on the surface of this Earth will increase. Earthquake and volcanos will follow. All the civilization will be swept (will be disappeared) by crustal movement. You may know well, we have numerous amount of waters on this Earth. When there is the crustal change (movement) on this Earth, then we expect <em>very</em> big tide, maybe 1000 meters of high (big tide) and when we have this tidal, then all the civilization in cities will be swept. What will happen later? Then we need a system and we should apply the principle to the system, then we will observe very simply. What human beings should do now, how they can save this human society when this catastrophe is over (is gone)? Actually the most serious thing in this circumstance, so many people just show hypothesis and theory, but nobody really wants to know the solution of this problem. They always claim something on the theory and hypothesis. I still don't know what do I know, what do I don't know. However, when I see the problem, I can see 'what is' in the problem. Then I find what is the answer and solution of the problem. This Earth has saved itself continuously by using what is in it (the problem in it). Recently, I found very frightening things during my study about the history of humankind. It was the secret that how this Earth could preserve itself for endless ages. This Earth works repeatedly (endlessly) by using what are in itself. This discovery was very, very helpful to me to solve the riddle of the Earth. I am studying about the future world (future generation) after this generation. No matter how superior I may, or I have very excellent view, but it's impossible for me to contribute for humankind alone. That's why I keep my traveling. The purpose of my traveling is looking for somebody who loves themselves. I started this travel more than 20 years ago. I haven't found anyone who really wants to learn why they have to live and what is in their lives. How can I talk to them about the world even they are not interested in their life itself (even themselves)? I still don't give even 1% of my knowledge to mankind.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs quietly*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>G: </strong>Well those are very interesting points of view. And I think the, from my own point of view, I think the science of climate change is robust, in terms of the cause of atmospheric temperature rise. But it's tied to the physics of the atmosphere and substances that we've introduced into the atmosphere, for example by combusting fossil fuel&hellip;. The physics of radiative transfer, from space to the Earth's surface, are robustly known. And what we're seeing is entirely consistent with human emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, in terms of forming. It would be interesting, I understand that this is a different point of view than the crack in gravity, and pointing this out raises another hypothesis that Earth scientists or physicists would want to explore&hellip; But I think right now we have the view that is making sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs quietly while Soyun is translating to him*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>These days, as you said, scientists found the cause of global warming from the greenhouse gas. It's okay, we can make sense from the theory. If global warming is caused by greenhouse gas, then we already have so serious unbalance in ecosystem now.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G: </strong>Well, I think the imbalance in the ecosystem is also human induced, and science&hellip; and humanity needs to address these imbalances. I'm in&ndash; I'm totally in agreement. We're using up the carrying capacity of the planet. &ndash; Which is what he's saying, in terms of the Earth needs to be in balance&hellip; But this is something that we can do, rather than resign ourselves to catastrophe.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>As I told you, the activities of core of this Earth has already started. That's why no human beings can stop the activities of inner of this Earth. This Earth is run by perfect science. For example when you already work (touch) a bomb (explosive)</p>

<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>Like dynamite</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>then how can you make it stop to be exploded? Things in the world has been determined; that's why nobody can change the decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G: </strong>I need to bring this to a close, if possible&hellip; because I must go back to my work. I do appreciate your visit, and I do appreciate listening to the points of view, and&hellip; I'll talk to other Earth scientists about the detection of disturbances of gravity. And, that's an interesting point of view, and if measurement of gravity fields allow us to detect such changes, then that's an important result. So I do appreciate your visit, and your time with me&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""><strong>S: </strong>What did you say about measurement of gravity? &hellip; The scientist is measuring gravity field?</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, did they found any change in the field?</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Uh, as far as I know, they can measure the change of the mass of Greenland and infer the amount &ndash; the fact &ndash; that Greenland is losing 15 cm of water per year. That's the accuracy with which they can measure gravity.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata replies and Soyun speaks with him briefly*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Okay, only one thing more&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yep</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>No doctors the modern medicine could check the energy in our body. (Modern medicine cannot check.) And gravity is a force (power) and this power becomes the origin of all the living creatures. This is the real cause that all the ecosystem to exist. &ndash;</p>

<p style=""><strong>G:</strong> Yeah&hellip; yeah&hellip; Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Thank you</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Bye</p>
