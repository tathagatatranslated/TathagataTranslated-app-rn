<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata</strong>:&nbsp; You still need much more experiences to understand this world.</p>
<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> I hope they're not so hard like this.</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The abbot we met today at the the temple is the person that the major of this city, Bangkok city, the general in the army, and the prime minister, they bow several times to him. If you saw that situation, you would probably stand on their side. In your view, he is very great. But I am not like that. I am nothing. If you can record our talking in case I meet him, then when you listen again, something that happens will be very funny. Because they are the Buddhist monks, I would ask them about Buddha's teaching. But you'll find in the recording that they don't realize anything about Buddha's teaching. There is a difference between Buddha's teaching and any other teaching of Saints. The difference is that Buddha teaches very clearly about the relations between causes and effects. All the ways exist in the problems. It is not Buddha's teaching if it doesn't teach what causes lead what result in what problems. All the effects are made by the causes, so the problems in the causes are the ways to create the results. Even though all the Buddhas who had appeared in the world discussed with me, then they can't be superior to me. Then who there can discuss with me about the truth? In the present, I'm wondering the world with very poor conditions, so nobody recognizes me. But the things I left through my living will be the best teaching for humankind. After my death, all the religions in this world will disappear. And, the hypocrites will try to make me their idol of religion again. That's why I'll record this very clearly. It is not so helpful to you to serve me. Instead, you should learn hard and awake yourself to obtain the way to find good self. I never want that I become a Buddha or idols after I die.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>Dominic:</strong> But it will probably happen anyway...</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yes, it will happen. It will go ten thousand years that they make me as idol. It will be the most honorable thing for you that you see things through this travel. It will be the best experience and most honorable thing through all your life. Before this travel, I nearly thought that I'd travel alone because Satto told me he couldn't come and Soyun also had some problem. But Satto is very lucky. It doesn't matter whether you feel or not what do you obtain through this traveling. But this is a real fact that you joined this travel. And also it is true that you will try to let people know my meaning that I want to leave hope for mankind. And all the results lie in these two facts. The Catholic pope always sells God but he doesn't know anything about the almighty God. Satto's mother told me in their religion they don't believe in reincarnation. So I told her it's not right to deny things that exist. If you plant a bean, it sprouts. It opens flowers, and it will bear fruits. And after bearing fruit, then the bean tree will die. The bean sprouts again and opens flowers and bears fruit again. We call it transmigration. Everything makes and revives what was in 'motae' (the origin). We call the activities as transmigration. We can see transmigration through everything. So it's not important for people to accept or not. It's more ridiculous that they don't admit this fact.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> But things like one stone can't make a fruit.</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> No, it also changes. It takes a long, long time. It changes to a small stone, then sand, then it changes to soil. And it can be a stone again. About water, every animal drinks water, but this world keeps the same quantity of water. It transforms a little bit in some processes. It evaporates, becomes clouds, and rains, and is water again. This modern society is very convenient to confirm everything by using some systems. But people tend not to admit and accept something exists because people lost much of themselves. If people meet me and they can understand how the world works and exists, then it's very easy for them to find the way to save themselves. And they can have hope. The reason that all the people tend to avoid me is that they forget themselves. So it's meaningless for me whether people receive me warmly or not. I'm just trying to tell them to give hope in this age so I explain what exists, how they exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="">Monday we will probably go to Chulalongkorn University, virtually the best school in this country. We will meet the principal of the university and ask him, "Do you know some truthful people around you?" It's ridiculous that very high monks refuse without any confirmation when they listen that Buddha comes.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>D: </strong>Not really&hellip;. It's ridiculous, yes, but understandable.</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What I do in London is just like this every day. So in this country, maybe I'll invite some high monks and give them teaching. I'm not sure when our travel plan will change because this is just wandering. If I can have a chance to have a meeting with the intelligent people or high monks then I can wait for them, maybe I can stay in Bangkok for one month. If I have a chance to have questions and give answers with such persons then I can wait here for one month or more. If they ask me, "Are you really a Tathagata?" then I'll ask them, "Do I look like a crazy man?" I continue such difficult, hard traveling for 20 years. But nobody treats me to one bottle of water because I do this work.&nbsp;Then, why should I do this? Am I crazy?</p>
<p style=""><strong>D</strong><strong>:</strong> Good question. If all your days are like today, I would have quit many years ago. One year or two years, ok, finish&hellip; find another hobby...</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have too much of trials and tests for this work. If I were not a Tathagata, how could I grow such a bright personality in spite of such terrible trials? Despite I never received any education, but I grew up very bright and purer than any other people. The Korean government knows this fact about me.</p>
<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Ask him about your interest. If you don't speak, he won't know.</p>
<p style=""><strong>D</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;No, no&hellip; I've got questions, but not today. If I start, I'll be here for too many hours, and I have to go back to my room and do some typing. But, tomorrow maybe. But before I leave, there's things that I have to know, so&hellip;.</p>
<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Because you joined our travel, we bought a very good new recorder and microphone.</p>
<p><span style="">....</span></p>
<p style=""><strong>T</strong>: When a teacher read that message that we're traveling to prevent destruction, he was upset and he asked, "Is he Jesus?"</p>
<p style="">"Why would Jesus come back here? Is he a crazy man? If he comes here he'll be beaten to death again." Jesus is different from Tathagata. There's only one person who can reveal what is in Truth, that is Tathagata.</p></div>
