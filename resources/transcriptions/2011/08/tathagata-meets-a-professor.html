<h3>Tathagata meets a professor</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Let me introduce Mr. SamHan Lee, and these are members of our society. Mr. SamHan Lee says, "I am very pleased to meet you."</p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata (Mr. Lee):</strong> The brain is one of my specialities. Maybe I am too philosophical so if I talk with people sometimes people find it very difficult to talk to me. I'm always ready to take any responsibility of what I speak. If I speak something wrong, I'll take all the responsibility.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Professor:</strong> I see. That's good.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Many times we experience very hardship during our lives. One of the cases is that when we contact something new that we don't understand before. I speak people usually the most difficult time is that you start to learn something very new for the first time. My real specialty is that what influence of what is in the present living reality to the future.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No one can know the future&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Not always&hellip;. When you understand, we can know everything in the world is determined. And the future is created by the problems (matters) in the present. If we have something wondering, please try to confirm how do I answer. The mathematician always uses the same formulas for the same type of questions. And they can solve all the questions from very small number to very large number by one principle. During this traveling I have met many scientists. Most of scientists have been trying to experiment and test without the correct principle about their research. It's very, very hard to see this world without any principle.&nbsp; So I tried to teach them how they can see easily about what they want to find out but they didn't like it.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I don't understand why&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You share with us a very precious time, so if I keep my talking I feel sorry for you. If you have any interest and some problems that you want to solve or find out, then why you don't you share us?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> When you ask how people do science, there's really no answer. People decide that a problem is interesting and they try to figure out how to understand it. But there's no set of principles or method, just a kind of&hellip; What we've learned from, you know, there was one scientific revolution, basically Galileo -- the idea was to idealize away from -- Aristotle could explain everything, he had an answer for everything. But nothing was explained well. And Galileo said look at something contained, try to explain that well and you can radiate out and explain more and more and more. That's a kind of working principle, but I don't know any other principles&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I usually meet some scientists who are researching environmental problems, global change, and the subject of gravity.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Gravity is what changed the way you understand the world, because prior to Newton, the belief was that the universe was mechanical, that there had to be pieces of everything, like a machine. What Newton showed is that you could have action at a distance, that things didn't have to touch one another, and there could be effects without any kind of contact. Newton thought it was crazy -- his own idea. It seemed mystical that could be something here and something there with nothing connecting them, so we start looking for what could be aether connecting them, little dots connecting them, then there was nothing connecting them. Basically, what Newton was able to show is that our commonsense was irrational, and that we had to throw away all this mechanical junk, and try to have theories that we can understand. It's an amazing change in the way we looked at the universe.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Yes, it was a great discovery at that age, but Newton didn't explain much in detail about gravity.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No, he didn't but that was a few hundred years ago. It's clear that there are things that we don't know about. For example, most of the universe is occupied by black matter and we don't know what it is. That's a pretty amazing idea that after all these years there's this whole area that we can't even show what it 's made out of. That's a pretty wild idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I thought scientists already know about gravity, because many people say about gravity.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The mystery of physics is trying to put together quantum mechanics on one hand and relativity on the other hand. They don't form a unified theory and that's the goal, to form a unified theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> However no scientist really knows what is the source of gravity -- how is gravity formed (generated)? And nobody has a close examination about the matter of how does gravity keep itself after they formed?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There's lots of questions one can ask, but we can't always answer them.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> They don't guess or expect which conditions can make gravity be cracked.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> You know, there are lots of problems, no doubt about it&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> They also didn't have any examination about what is the real role of gravity.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh, what puts the whole thing together.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>So I wanted to give my information (knowledge) and plans but still I cannot find the best way for that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There are a lot of questions to ask&hellip; But it's not clear that there are answers to all the questions. Human beings don't have unlimited possibility to understand what's around them. They're not angels.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (secretary):</strong> You mean they have limitations.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh yeah, they can understand some things but not other things.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> This morning we visited the Earth science department. We found all the scientists are too busy so we couldn't find any way to give our information. And they will not see forever the really important things. So you know, if somebody really starts to understand about the field of their studies then from that time they don't have something to do. I'm proud that my society has better knowledge and information of life sciences than NASA or any institute in America. In spite of our excellent information and knowledge, we don't find anything to do, that's why we keep our traveling and we try to see what happens in this world. You may use this very, very funny episode when you meet others; maybe you can court with this episode. There are many people who make a big queue to learn from somebody who really doesn't know. You know, somebody who really doesn't know is always trying to teach others and they struggle to teach others without their understanding of what they teach.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>That's a way of looking at the world. The way we work in this department is that we have the faculty and students but they intermix and often the ideas come from both ways. It's not that we teach them what to do, they often teach us what to do.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> You are really qualified to be a professor. We haven't met the professors who speak like you. We have visited so many universities around the world, but we often found very good students, but not so good professors.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> A lot of scientists don't think so much about how they do something or underlying principles, but because of Chomsky in our department, he thinks a lot about these things. He spends a lot of time thinking about questions of philosophy of science. And I think that influences the rest of us in this faculty.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>I am very interested in meeting with him. I am very interested and wondering what he can see from his knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> He's written a number of books.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's not so important to write books. The important point is how much the content in books can contribute to people in society. I've got three terms that I can listen even from children. My son, when he was in elementary school, asked me these questions. In case I have a chance to meet Noam Chomsky, then I would like to ask him about these three terms. If he knows about these and if he can give me one of the right answers, then I will be his slave for the rest of my life. We will knock at his office this afternoon but I don't expect much because he must be very busy.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well he's pretty hard to come by. He has speaking engagements for three years ahead of time&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If some people who really know, they don't need much of languages. They only need to prove the truth of their words. And I can show all of evidences that I speak the truth to his questions. You will not prove anything that he can see the truth from his words. It is not so important for human beings that how much they have respect from others. The most valuable thing is that how much we are truthful. Any kind of teachings doesn't have any value if they don't have truth in them.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The truth&hellip; you gotta be careful there. Being truthful is one concept, but scientific truth is a totally different concept. This is the notion that or theory about what is true about the universe, and in that sense there is no scientific truth, or if there is, there it sort of pretends to. Well, many people think now that what scientists do, the goal of science, is to come up with theories that are comprehensible. Whether or not they're true about that world out there is something we can't know. And the more we work with more complex systems like the human mind, the less we can make any claims to truth. What we can have is comprehensible hypothesis. But truth is a totally different thing. And being a truthful person is a very different concept.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People should prove the truthfulness in their words if some people who cannot understand what they speak.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, your work has to be honest&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If we view the science and philosophy separately, it seems very distant. But when you see in the same way, the philosophy and science, they are like the two sides of one coin.</p>
