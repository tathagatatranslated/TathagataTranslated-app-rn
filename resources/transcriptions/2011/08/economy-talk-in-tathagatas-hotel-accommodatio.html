<h3>Economy talk at Tathagata's hotel accommodation during Thailand travel, 2004</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Question from member: </strong>With money, or with enough money, even yesterday, we could have arranged an interview with the big, big monk and the American translator; If we give a donation and we ask if they have enough time, it's "Oh sure sure, please, please come." But I have no money, but I'd like to be your patron. So, to be your patron, I need to get my hands on some money. Now, I've been thinking, well, I'd like to try to do that by writing a book. And, I'd like to use the book to give mankind a message, my own message. But there's things that I need to know before I can actually write the book. Now, the story itself, the book itself, I'd like it to be allegorical&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Allegorical?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>Allegory. It means, it works on two levels. So you've got the normal story and then I'd like to have my characters all represent different things, and then use these characters to tell a story to humanity. Now, my central character represents humanity itself, mankind, and where the book begins, is that he's committed suicide. And basically what I'm saying is that mankind, this modern mankind is finished. So, as he's about to die, he remembers how he actually got to that point. And so, it starts there, it goes back here and then he tells a story about how he got there. Now, the book itself is a book of three parts. And in the first part, he has a normal life, or, a life. And then, something happens to him, and Tathagata's in the book, right, that's why I can't actually finish it, because I want Tathagata to tell me what he thinks, if he wants to put anything in the book himself. So, what happens is, my character is going to work, and Tathagata is there, and I got the idea from the sign. And basically, he says to my character, to humanity, "Why don't you go that way?" And my character's going to work, doing normal life, and he says, "No, no, no, I'll go that way" and then Tathagata says, "Are you sure? Maybe you should go that way, it's better for you." and humanity says, "No, no, no, not gonna go that way." And then, well, we're gonna be here a while.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>But she has to translate. It's too much&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> How about I write it down? I'll write it down then you can translate and ask?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto: </strong>Yes, better, better. Because you say so many things that I don't think she will tell.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates part for Tathagata*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun: </strong>Even though I want to explain, he doesn't want to listen, now...</p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata: </strong>Master sees this world. We don't need to worry about money for our living.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> If he uses his brain a little bit, then it's no problem.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I will tell you a very simple explanation. After three years*, this world will be tangled with the problem of food.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> In 2007 or 2008?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Three years later&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> 2007.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes. Food problem will be very serious.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata begins to explain*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So, His simple idea is that we buy big land in Australia, or Canada, or Malaysia, or Borneo Island, and we set up a company.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When we make a foundation for agriculture, then after three years, we have income from that. Year by year, our income will increase. Most of the people in the world neglect agriculture, this is just a primitive industry. That's why this is a very good opportunity. This is also one reason that I have a long-term visa is Malaysia. Australia also has good land.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> The actual dirt itself, the soil, is very poor.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Soil is poor.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, the topsoil. It's not very good. Farming's done, but we've got a problem with rising salinity and acidity of the soil.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We'll finish all this travel one and a half months and after that we will concentrate about business to make income.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> What is the cause of that there is going to be hunger, or there's not going to be food?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> This world is full of the wave of industrials. Huge lands developed into industrial areas. They use land for building housings, and roads. They are the causes to make shorter the farming land. China is exporting food at 20 million tons per year. But next year, they produce food just for themselves. Vietnam, and Malaysia, Thailand, they still export food. But these countries also make shorter the farming land.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> The soil itself is less productive?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> No, they change to industrial&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> From next year, the price of the grains will increase.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun: </strong>From 2005.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And in 2008, the price will go up very quickly. So, people who knows my abilities are willing to invest money in my business. But I don't accept people without the decision that they want to save themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So it means that he only needs somebody who wants to save themselves. If they just want money and interest then he doesn't need them.</p>
