<h3>Meeting at a climate research funding organization</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> I am very concerned about the future of this world. Today's scientists cannot find exactly what will happen from this climate change in this world. In this moment the most serious thing about this issue is not climate change, but the more important thing is that there is a change of the temperature of the surface of this Earth. In order to solve this riddle, we need to start to check from the activities of the gravity field. However the scientific world uses very frequently the term of 'gravity', modern scientists do not find what is the role of the gravity to the ecosystem, and secondly, how the gravity was formed. How does it preserve itself? And what circumstances (situation) occur the crack of gravity field? No scientists want to know this truth, or no one knows about this fact. Scientists only check about the pressure in the atmosphere by experiments of collision. But it's impossible for them to reveal the substance of gravity. This is the most serious matter at this moment. The crack in the gravity field has already started. Because of this crack, the activities of inside of the Earth has started. As the evidence of this activities, people find that the temperature of this Earth are increasing. I can explain about this by, finally, cases. For example, we have energy power in our body and energy controls our body and support our activities. Gravity is just like the energy in our body but it's for the Earth. We cannot see gravity with our naked eyes. But the power of gravity is really essential for the activities of all the living creatures. When the power becomes weak, the function of immunity becomes to lose.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Now, he explains to compare to our body the energy because the gravity of Earth is like the energy in our body, so we have very weak energy in our body then they can't make the new cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> In this case, our body becomes very weak and we cannot protect ourselves from disease, and it's possible for the living creatures become to die. The role of gravity is just like the energy (power) in our body. If you see this Earth from our widened vision, the Earth is like a model body of living creatures. So when you study about the environment, and ecological climate issue, then the first point should be studying from the gravity problem. Some scientists claim that the global warming is from greenhouse gas. And this gas also has power to neutralize the power of gravity. That's why it doesn't exist, that scientist's claim about global warming. I wanted to tell these facts to American scientists so I have been traveling this country for one month. But I couldn't find any one American scientist who really wanted to know about this matter. Things in the world is just like the matter in mathematics. When you observe one matter, we will find different characters when the problem change. So when you study about global warming, we cannot solve the real problem without understanding the substance (the reality) of living creatures. The most dangerous enemies in saving this world are modern scientists. The causes of global warming and all pollutions confront modern civilization. Modern civilization has broken the balances of the natural world. The result is that it causes the creation of gravity to stop. And what happens from the result that the creation of gravity is stopped? Then we need a very simple system to prove this. My information is very, very important. I would like to give my information to some people who really love this Earth, but in case if some bad people have my information, it will cause something disaster. This world lets all the phenomenal world to exist by using the problems. That's why if somebody has the view how they can see this world by principle and problems, then anybody can change the destiny of this Earth. That's why I'm traveling to find out good scientists. If I could have met good scientists, I wanted to discuss about how we can create water and air outside of this Earth. In fact, this is possible if we have some experiments. But because I couldn't meet any good people, I'm going back two days later. I didn't come here to fight against the scientists. The scientists only have read the books that others wrote, and they always have very abstract ideas. I haven't mentioned even how the scientists and the scientific world in this world is so ignorant before I started this traveling. If you have any questions, please ask me.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> So as I understand it then, the goal of your visit was to find a scientist to do experiments that show the relationship between gravity and CO<sub>2</sub> and the effect on temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yes. I wanted to cooperate with them. And secondly, I wanted to understand what today's mankind really wants. I would like to explain in short why I could speak like this. Most people have already known what I wanted to speak now. Inside this earth there's the level of heat. Heat creates the other materials, and by using the materials the heat created, it also keeps itself. When some kind of problems happen in the gravity field, these materials inside of the Earth start their own activities. In some cases, it only causes climate change. In this case, we can compare it to just we have a flu (catch a cold). But the most serious case is that the heat level creates the kind of core that according to the time that passes, the core what is created starts to work to increasing itself. And by increasing itself, the temperature on the surface is increasing. I can explain with this case. When somebody has a kind of disease and if he becomes very ill, the body temperature becomes increasing. Our normal temperature is 36&deg;C. But when they are very seriously ill, our temperature becomes 39&deg; or more. Then the doctors say that the patient is in the circumstance of danger. At the moment we have 1&deg; of increasing of the temperature on the surface. So it is not so harmful to the ecosystem. But when the core that is created makes the number increase then the temperature will go up 2 or 3&deg;. We expect that what happens in this earth from the effect of this temperature, then this Earth cannot stand the pressure. So it will become to escape as volcano. This is the first symptom - earthquakes, or volcanos. If it becomes more serious, it will cause crustal change. In this case, there will be tremendous tides from the flow of the sea. There is the possibility that the big tides may go 1000 meters high. In this case, from these waves, all civilizations on this Earth may be disappeared. This is not so good phenomenon that all this information become known to others. But if there are some people who feel that they are very responsible of these kind of symptoms they should help to solve this problem. Unfortunately, I haven't met good people yet. And no government supports me to research this matter. Fortunately I have the best knowledge about life science. That's why I could solve all the riddles of this Earth by pursuing the origin of all the creatures. I hope our meeting will be helpful to this world. If you have any questions, please let me know. If my answers are going to be stopped by your question then now I'm telling a lie. But if I'm not stopped by your questions, I am speaking the truth. What I'm speaking now and all of my answers, it's not possible to come from any books and from people's thought. During my traveling, sometimes I spend my time to check out the explanation of the terms in the great dictionaries. In many cases I found out they didn't explain properly about the meanings of the terms. That's why it's impossible for people to find out solution through the books. Moreover, it's impossible for anyone to solve this kind of problem by very small part of experiments. NASA claims that they will reveal soon about the substance of gravity. But this morning we also contacted the people in NASA. But we found that they were not really interested in research of gravity fields. They always develop and make all the theories without correct grounds. It's impossible for them to understand the real substance of the gravity by experiments of collision or pressure of air. Now, I start to doubt about their true color after meeting with them. Their research will not be helpful at all for the future of mankind and help people to exist in this Earth. There is one secret in this world. Some people who never done anything good never receive good people. They (people who have never done anything good) are very clever to use their brain to do something bad. According to our research, those kinds of people don't have 0.1 cm of view about something good. You will not believe but we can find all the evidences in any places in the phenomenal world to confirm what I speak now. There's no creatures who can receive something that they don't have in themselves. According to my calculations, if we let scientists to solve this problem, then this world will be extinguished (ruined) within 10 years.* When they listen to me, they always demand me to send any paper evidence, or report. In case we cannot confirm with our naked eyes, we can use a kind of system to confirm all of them.The ground of my claim is that everything in this world keeps its change by one principle. That's why if we make any system by using what is in this principle, it makes us possible to confirm anything. However, the existing authorities don't want to receive the information to keep their own power. This is the biggest problem at this moment. Yesterday I visited one university and somebody asked me, "Where did you get your Ph.D degree?" If there has been somebody who could give me this information (knowledge) then this mankind haven't faced this all kind of problems now. I told him, "No geniuses had degree from others. But the genius never tell a lie. All the evidences are in this world itself. It is possible for us to confirm all these evidences in anywhere in the world. I only suggest my evidences in front of some people who have intention to check out those evidences." When I told this to him, he asked me of his specialty and where our body power comes from. So I answered to his question, "Where does the power of a car come from?" And he told me, "Gasoline generated the power of the car." The human body absorbs the energy when we eat food. And by using the power (energy) we generate power in our body. We need two points of view to observe this. One case is that we use lots amount of gasoline for cars, but there's not so much power generated. But some cars generated a big power from a small amount of gasoline. The cause of these two differences was in the engine of the cars. We just compare it to a car - our bodies are different. Some people's body can generate lots of power and energy from a small amount of food. Some people are different. Even though they have lots of food, they generate only small power in their body. It's a difference. We can solve this world problem very easily when we see in the simple way but if we make it very complicated in the way to see the world, then it's very very hard to understand the way of this world. If you doubt or need more explanation about what I told you, then please let me know.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Well I'm not a scientist, so I'm not here to try to disprove or approve of the ideas and theories about the effects of gravity in the larger global climate. If it's true, it's even more depressing to me. Because we already know that the technology we have emits greenhouse gasses, but the effect of that, there's already climate change that occurs from technology and progress, so if there is additional impact from gravity, then the consequences are only going to be much more severe. So that is on top of what we already do. What we try to do here in supporting the research is we understand that what needs to be done has to be done at a very, very large scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> You mean the scale of supporting?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, if we want to somehow make a change, a change in behavior, or a change in our transportation, or how we consume power, or how we consume energy in any way that emits greenhouse gasses, it has to be widely adopted. You know, just me changing my behavior won't have a big impact on really changing the temperature of the world. So you need the millions of people to change their behavior, or how they consume energy, how they move, how they transport themselves.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So your suggestion to protect the people to this serious environmental problem</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> My point is that if something needs to change, somehow, whether it be energy, it needs to happen on a very, very, very large scale.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Then there's hope (possibility).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, sure, there's hope. But we don't know what's gonna work. So, we try to look at a lot of different ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> There are many, many environmental movements and many people are engaged in the movements, but they have wrong point now. It's true that greenhouse gasses influence the environment. It's very easy for us to confirm this. All the materials have their own nature. They always fight against something that is not similar. The gravity power (energy) fights against greenhouse gas, and there is a rule: the stronger eat the weaker. So when the gravity power is stronger than the greenhouse gas, then it eats that one, and then the greenhouse gas will become absorbed in the gravity's power. Like some scientists' claims, if there is a 1&deg; increase in temperature of the surface of this earth there will cause great change in this ecosystem. I haven't read any article naming a certain reason there are numerous living creatures that suddenly died (disappeared) because of this climate change. I don't say the scientists don't have grounds of their claims, but they exaggerate too much. That's why when I listen to their claims it seems like I'm reading a novel (fiction). Because of greenhouse gas, a little bit of gravity power can be destroyed. In the future, if you need me then if you send your problems exactly, what is your problem (question), then give me some materials of your research, then I will analyze very exactly what is in your issue. I'm very sorry because I didn't meet your director, today. If she might be interested in me, I could give very good information for your research. I am pleased to meet you because you gave us your time, I have a chance to tell you some of the truth. The phenomenon always existed in the past mankinds as well. When civilization developed, this result always happened to those generations. I have quite knowledge in physics and very excellent knowledge in life sciences' part. During I'm living on this Earth, when you need me, then please contact me, whatever, I will try to help you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> During this traveling we have visited ten universities. But we didn't have so good result. Stanford University is the last course of this traveling. Now we left only four hours to work there. When you have any questions, even personal things, please ask me. Please test me if I can solve some questions or not. If I cannot solve it, that's just fine, nothing lost. But if I can solve, then it's very big for you. Or when you try to write a paper, if you find something that you cannot understand, please ask me. When you give me a question then you should point out very exactly what matter do you want to see.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (secretary):</strong> So that's our cellphone here in the US in case you can contact, maybe today, if the director wants to meet us.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q:</strong> He has meetings today, unfortunately, but I'm afraid I won't be able to properly relay your message, so if you have written down anything about your ideas, then I can forward it to them. Because I don't know if I can express those ideas properly, but if he has written any sort of summary of your ideas, I can&hellip; It doesn't have to be scientific, just a summary.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When I was in England, London, I visited Nature, the scientific magazine, to inform this matter to people. When I met the editor in chief at the magazine, he demanded me to write a paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Q: </strong>Oh I didn't mean published. It doesn't have to be published, just&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> No, no&hellip; he is explaining about writing&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> He tries to explain about writing...</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I asked him, "If I write a paper, then could you understand what I speak?" And he answered that, "We have lots of high intellectuals around us."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="">"Then I want to confirm first, and later I'll write papers for you." I told him, "I would like to ask you one thing, and please answer to my question." I asked him, "What is the criteria of good writing and bad writing?" But he became mad and he thought for a long time, but he said that it's too difficult a question. Even though I write a very good paper, but if you do not understand what I write, then it's useless. I wouldn't write anything very important and provide you all the information in writing when you don't have eyes (view) to understand them.&nbsp;</p>
