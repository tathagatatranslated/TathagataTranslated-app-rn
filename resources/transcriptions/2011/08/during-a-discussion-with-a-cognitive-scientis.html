<h3>During a discussion with a cognitive scientist</h3>
</div>
<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata: </strong>Today's science has great development about something that is visible. But they have many mistakes about something invisible.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Professor of cognitive science: </strong>I think I don't quite understand. So...</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> So, about things that we cannot see through our naked eyes</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>Right, so, you're saying that the brain makes mistakes, is that what you're saying? I'm not sure I understand what he's saying.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's right. Scientists have some wrong understanding about the role of the brain.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> In what way?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I would like to tell you one example. If I compare the brain to the car, then the brain is like a battery in a car. It means that the brain in our body is just like the electric source in the automobile.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Because today's scientists are trying to find the role of the brain they try to find out the source of the memory, and the perception, through only the brain. It's difficult for them to find out exactly about that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes, it's very complicated.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The role of the brain is to transmit, through neural systems, something in consciousness. The brain works to transmit to the consciousness what it learned and saw. It also works to express what accumulated in our consciousness through the brain. We need two parts to observe about how our body recognizes and perceives. So far, the scientists have been observing through only one part.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> It means that only body.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's why they failed to find out very correct information about this part. If you have any questions, please let me know.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Oh sure, no that's fine. Yes, so, I actually don't study perception, per se, I study memory.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> You study memory</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Mhm</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, go on&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>And what I'm interested in are the molecular processes that are involved in memory.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Would you explain about 'molecular'?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Sure, so, some people study memory as you said, by understanding regions of the brain or the circuits in the brain. We try to go even more basic, to understand the molecules that are involved in certain circuits that are involved in memory.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Our consciousness is composed of energy. And this energy controls our body. In religion, they call the reality of this energy as 'soul'. What we see, what we read, what we learn, all of them accumulate in consciousness. Our brain plays the role to express things that accumulate in our consciousness from outside and they receive the matters from outside and transmit to consciousness. That's the role of the brain.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Right, but I would argue that your consciousness is actually contained somehow within your brain. I don't think it's a separate entity and I think that a challenge of neuroscience is to understand that, how biologically, is the consciousness expressed? Right? It's a very difficult question.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We need to observe through many of examples. Our consciousness plays the role of a driver of a car.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's right. I agree with that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Our body is no more than the tool of our consciousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I would agree with that also.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> According to my research about religious people, or psychic mediums, and so on, lots of those people live with the third souls (third consciousness). When the other consciousness occupy their own consciousness, their own consciousness become into the state of dormancy. When I met a psychologist, he gave me this question, "Many of people today act on unconsciousness." So I gave this answer, "When a soul outside invades into another living persons and the soul occupy the other's one, then the own consciousness became to the state of dormancy. That's why we can see many examples that they do not remember what they've done in many case."</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>Right, sure, but I think I would always argue that there is a biological basis for all of these observations. Right? So, any change in somebody's consciousness or forgetting previously stored information that there's a biological basis for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>Everything in the world is run by one principle. When we see all the matters on the principle, we can find all the results and answer from that. But, humans' vision are lack to see the principle. That's why they cannot find answer of matters on the principle. In this case, we need a very simple system. We need a system, and we put matter on principle. So we have principle matter and question. Then we can see the result in the questions. So, I solved all the riddles that humankind couldn't solve so far. I could understand about the behaviors of people (how those behaviors come from certain people). However, it's very, very hard for people to receive this right knowledge. I could find this fact after I finished my research. There are too many people who cannot receive something good even though I really want to give them. If people don't understand this fundamental truth, people will make lots of mistakes in their work. I would like to tell you a very interesting episode (story). When Bush started the war and tried to change Iraq society to democracy, but he didn't calculate one thing. Bush's administration estimated Iraqi people just same as American people. The Iraqi people have Allah, which you don't have in this country. But he didn't calculate this fact, that they have Allah. Allah controls all the gods in Arab. There are numerous spirits who are controlled by Allah, but when they come into human body, then those people are not afraid of death. Because they can conquer human body and control them. Hussein was a tyrant, but he was the child of Allah. But even if Bush tried to give lots of benefit there (money, army,&nbsp; &hellip;) but still Bush is not a child of Allah. If America doesn't understand this fact, America will not get anything from Iraq. It will not finish when America makes Iraq settled. There are other countries around there and they will start to conflict.<strong>*</strong> And all the gods who are controlled by Allah can use others in Arab countries. When you govern this world, all the power is not enough. You need lots of knowledge and understanding. American government don't have this knowledge.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I would agree with you there.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you point out the question (problem) very accurately then I can also answer very correctly. I explain all the things very simply, but this kind of conversation must be your first experience. That's why it will be very difficult for you to listen. When you talk to people like me, you need to know what exists in the organ of consciousness. Everything that were related to us and everything that our consciousness receives becomes to a Motae that makes our life to exist. What is in motae wants that it always act. It doesn't want to stop to act. Here, let's have a very simple case. When a good person has victory, then the evils must surrender. Something evil in ourselves always intrudes that we receive something good. Most of people find it very, very difficult to receive goodness, but it's easy to receive something bad. During my traveling and during my conversation, I sometimes check the dictionary. Some questions which came from children (elementary school boys and girls) and I gave same questions to very higher intellectuals, but they couldn't answer. I thought it was very strange phenomenon. I tried to check on the dictionary. And when I searched their meanings in the dictionary, they didn't explain correctly about them. I haven't found any correct meaning of explaining in the dictionary about some terms something that's really helpful for human's awakening, human's enlightenment, to change their life better. This matter is the evidence that there's no one who really wants to learn something good and no one who really understands something good. I spend lots of time to solve all the riddles in this world. Instead, I became to know about the world what I wanted to know. As the result, I had to lose everything I had. When my level of consciousness went up, my friends around me moved away. Also all my relatives felt very distant of me, and all of my supporters who followed me disappeared. I met some amount of people but most of them are very poor and suffering and has lots of problems in their lives. When they come to me with problems that they couldn't solve through all their lives, they found solution and answers immediately from me. But they never come back to me. So one time was enough for them.</p>
<p style="">At that time, I couldn't understand really why those things happened. But now I understand why. During my traveling, I have met so many kinds of people and I have lots of interesting episodes with them. When I traveled India I visited Nehru University. I requested the vice chancellor in Nehru University to introduce some excellent professors in the university and he said that, "Oh, I am one of them. Why not? I want to meet him." So the following day, I met him in his office and I answered to his few questions. So he asked me, "A man like you who is very unusual, how are you treated in your country?" So I gave him very frank answer, "I'm not a person who is treated well from my country. Even in my home I'm not treated well by my wife." When he listened to my answer, his attitude changed. He became very humble and he said to me, "I trust what you spoke." Whenever we visit India, New Delhi, his secretary always comes to us and welcomes us. We cannot say because we have great knowledge we are very welcomed by people. Through my traveling America this time, I have quite good fruit. One interesting thing is that I knew that the scientists in this country had lots of knowledge about gravity because when I read newspapers or from media, they always mention about gravity. But no one knew the reality of gravity now. When I asked them what is the role of gravity on the ecosystem on this Earth, they didn't know anything about that. I asked them how gravity was formed and when. They didn't have any answers. I asked them how gravity that is formed always keep and preserve itself. Nobody knows. When gravity is cracked, what will happen on Earth? Nobody knows. Because they didn't answer, I asked them, Please ask me. But nobody asked me. This is the reality today. During my conversation with the scientists, I could realize what is in reality of gravity. Gravity plays a great role on the ecosystem. When gravity is cracked, all the civilizations of this generation will be disappeared immediately. But they don't try to know the real thing on this. Instead, they always try to on their own hypothesis and write papers,</p>

<p style=""><strong>P (with a laugh):</strong> That's right&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And they give a great prize&hellip;. The scientists told me they make photos of gravity through satellites. But from my point of view, gravity cannot be photoed. So their photograph is atmosphere, not gravity. It means that modern science cannot examine the matters that is invisible, exactly.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Some people would disagree with you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Disagree with you</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's right. There is an oriental saying, "Even if you gain all of this world, if you lose yourself, it's useless." What do you think of this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well I think you make a very - you think of things more as philosophical and theological whereas I think more as a scientist. So, these questions of mind and the brain are questions - where is the mind in the brain?", or where is the soul in the brain - are questions that I think some scientists would say they can address. Right? By doing experiments.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> They cannot address.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I think scientists would say that they can. Right? And I think that philosophers and theologians argue that we can't. And so there's a difference of opinion.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I never speak of my imagination, my thought, hypothesis. When I meet some people who don't believe in me, I start my conversation with them under the condition that if 1% of mistake in my words are found in the result, then I'll take all the responsibility of my mistake.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> How much true or how much wrong in what he speaks can be found in only confirmation of the result.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I haven't found any 1% of misunderstanding in my saying so far after my confirmation through all the examples. People don't regard much of my wisdom. But they are quite impressed with my life itself. I don't work much, I always keep traveling. But I don't have any problem in my family. Nothing lack in my living. How about my income? Even though I do same thing with others, but I can make big money in a very short time. I don't have much experience in working - I don't have skills or techniques in working. What I do in my working, the secret to make great income in a short time, I always observe workers and I estimate their capacity, and I always use of their abilities. Whenever I start to work something, I make 10 or 20 times more profit than my competitors. So when I need money, I just go out to work. That's my life. When we know something we can solve all the problems in us by using our knowledge. I wish my life will be contribute for this world. However, I may go back without giving all my knowledge for human beings. If you find that my knowledge is useful to your life, then please let me know. I can promise you that I will not make any 1% of mistake in my answering, so if you give any questions I'll give very sincere answers to you. If I speak like this, people who have no level of consciousness regard me as a crazy man. If I speak something very absurd, and not correct in the result, then I'm a very strange guy. But if what I speak is all correct in the result, then I am a very accurate person. When they listen to me, if they think of me very strangely, then they should ask me, "What is your standard and criteria of your speaking?" But I haven't met any one person who gave this question to me even though they regard me as strange one. Owing to them, I succeed to understand deeper of this world. The geniuses always give great teachings in their agonies. I have excellent knowledge about politics, economy, and management as well. In the future, if we become interested in one another, then you will find a very great benefit in your life. In your academic working, if you need a very great, great paper then please let me know. Within one hour, I can make a great paper that the ordinary people cannot imagine. But in your position, you need about five or seven days to understand about a certain subject that you want to write. We cannot imagine how many years, maybe 10 years, or 15 years, to work down this subject. If your vision cannot reach, however you think over and over, you cannot understand that point. But, if I point of one object, and help you, then you see that. Then you can understand immediately what it is.&nbsp;</p>
