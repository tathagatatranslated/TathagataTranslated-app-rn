<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> I'd like to start our conversation after confirmation of one thing, because I don't want to have a misunderstanding. During our conversation, if something that I speak doesn't touch in your consciousness, please ask again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Professor of physics:</strong> Okay, thank you.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I've met lots of people around the world, but because of the difference of our view, I found there was so high of a barrier between us in conversation. Could you understand this example? Numerous people have been born in this world, but among there are very special being can be born into this world. Then, from now on, I would like to ask you what I'm wondering. What is your specialty?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Geodesy. Want me to write it down? It's the study of the shape of the Earth, and the gravitational fields, and the deformation of the Earth.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I wanted to meet a person like you from a long time ago. I have been wondering, how do you understand gravity?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He means how do modern scientists understand gravity?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> What is the substance of gravity that scientists define?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> For me? I'm not sure what you mean, the substance of gravity. Do you want me to describe a little more?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The reality of gravity</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's a good question. For me, the reality of gravity is the effect of gravity that you can measure on a mass. So, for us, gravity is the force of gravity and the acceleration of gravity. We can measure the gravity field of the Earth with very high accuracy now.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Then I'd like to ask you again, have you learned how has gravity formed and what is the real role of gravity, and how does gravity preserve itself?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> No, that's not my area of expertise. My area is in measuring gravity and gravity changes, but not the&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The source of gravity</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The source of gravity, or the&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> How is it vanished</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes. Right, why it takes its form. That is not my speciality. And I'm afraid I don't know anything about that either. I only know what's in my field.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> How do you measure gravity?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> We measure gravity by - well, there's a number of ways. That's a big question. The fundamental way is to measure the acceleration of a mass.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Of a mass</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> You know what I mean when I say mass?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, mass.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's not easy to measure the gravity by any instruments because we cannot see gravity with our physical eyes. In order to develop the instruments, we need to understand exactly the reality of gravity. When you have any kind of instruments from theories, then it always show us the theory only and the effect of theory. Do you have any new information recently during your research of the surface of the Earth?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I'm working on some papers now, but the latest way to measure is the GRACE satellite. Are you familiar with this?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes the GRACE&hellip; NASA?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> NASA, yes. So we use that to measure the change of gravity but as you say, we model it, we actually measure the acceleration of two spacecraft and we interpret that in terms of the model that we have for gravity.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The most important role of gravity is to make the world of the creatures exist.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Exist</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, essential role</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Gravity has got the real cause of all the creatures.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When a certain regular gravity cause power, then in that situation, very normal the activities of all the creature can keep.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I'm not sure I understand that.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> The force of the gravity field has got a certain standard or power, then all the activities of all the creatures come.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I find it quite difficult to explain about gravity to the scientists.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, I understand&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> First, modern scientists did not examine closely how has the gravity field been formed - they didn't find the real source (the cause of gravity's formation).</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's true. It's an observed phenomenon, but we do not understand why it is there.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Secondly, modern scientists cannot reveal this matter how something what is formed once can keep (preserve) itself without losing them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> About gravity?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Of course, gravity as well. When gravity is formed once, it's there, how can keep itself?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes. The energy&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> And scientists cannot calculate what kind of situation can make it lose itself (disappear).</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> That's correct, as far as I know.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's why nobody knows how many hours or how many periods the scientists need to solve the mystery of the world.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay, we're working on it.</p>

<p style="">*all laughing*</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Some of my information are very essential to understand the future of the world, and all of the matters will be caused by the influence of gravity. I'm not sure, have you heard that recently the temperature of the surface of Earth is increasing?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>Yes.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>How do you understand about this matter? What is your answer about this phenomenon?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>That's a long question and answer, too. Of course global warming is the typical way people answer it. So I think you're getting at global warming. That could be influenced by external influences (the sun, &hellip;), and also internal, atmospheric influences (greenhouse gasses and such). That's the typical explanation.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Those kind of explanations are because the view of scientists cannot see what is in living reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay, could I say some things? The view of scientists is based on our observation and understanding. If we lack understanding, that's okay, because that's when we learn new things. But we tie our understanding to observations, always. It's not based on our philosophy but on what we see in nature happen. That's what we base that on. But we may have an imperfect understanding. That's normal. But if someone wants to tell us that we're wrong, they have to produce a new prediction and compare it to data, to observations.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, of course&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, you're right. We need to examine the matter very closely from the little (simple) system. We need to confirm from the system. If I put my information together, then the claims of modern scientists are quite distant from my conclusion. If we don't solve this issue in short term, then mankind will face the perfect vanish (extinguish). So I sent email to NASA two days ago, but I don't have reply yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Who did you email?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> The director of GRACE</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto (secretary, sound engineer):</strong> Yes, from the GRACE research. On the internet, the one with the GRACE project</p>

<p style=""><strong>P: </strong>Well, they're very busy. They don't return my emails in two days either, so that may be part of it.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> But now we found two person more which we may contact in Stanford.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> But you know, I think that what you're doing now is you're telling your conclusions, you say that the conclusions are different, your conclusions are important, and your conclusions are, I don't know, maybe you call them revolutionary. But no one is going to -- I don't know what to do with that without seeing, not the conclusions, but the reasoning that leads up to the conclusions, and the comparison to data. And the only way to do that is the normal route of publication or presentation at meetings -- meetings like the American Geophysical Union, and the AGU, are open. And there's an AGU meeting coming up in the spring. You can submit an abstract and you can give your talk. But, you can't just say your conclusions. You must say your reasoning, otherwise, you know, I don't trust my own colleagues when they give me their conclusions. Not as a person, you know, I say, okay, prove it to me. I don't know any other way, even visiting NASA. Unless, in a meeting like this, even if we were to have two to three hours, how could you convince someone? If those conclusions are more unusual, the burden and the difficulty is greater.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We need a kind of system here and we give 30&deg; C heat to one point in space. We have two kinds of ways to increase the temperature on the surface of the Earth: from interior and from exterior.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes, mhm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In order to increase temperature from exterior by 1&deg; C, maybe 2 or 3&deg; of heat should be given there. If we cannot perceive this phenomenon from the influence of outside, then we should measure from the inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> They do measure heat inside, at least they do measure heat flow at the surface, so they do measure the amount of heat that's coming up from beneath, it's called heat flow measurements.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In fact, it's impossible for scientists to analyze if they don't have perfect instruments to measure and observe the movement of the gravity field. So it's very difficult for scientists to examine that. So we cannot see what happen with our physical eyes in the gravity field, but when the gravity field is cracked, then it influences the activity of the basis of the Earth.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay but I don't think a crack in the gravity field has ever been observed. Are you saying we cannot observe it?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mhm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So a crack in the gravity field happens but you cannot observe it?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Mhm.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> If it has any influence, it must be, at least the effects must be observable.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I haven't learned this situation from the information of scientists now. If we want to understand exactly about this matter, first of all we need to know how does this Earth keep itself forever. But, it will be very few people who can understand if I explain this.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Can I go back a bit? I still am trying to understand are these effects observable or not.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's possible to observe in theory. We can make a certain system to observe this. This modern science developed the nuclear bomb. You of course can understand when one nuclear reaction is created, then it divides itself and increases its numbers numerously. Because, in the beginning it's developed very slowly. That's why it's difficult to observe by physical eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> I'm sorry I have a meeting now, but, I mean if you can observe it, then you should tell scientists how to observe it. But if it cannot be easily observed at the moment, then scientists are the wrong people to talk to. Cause we only - we don't change our theories because we want to. We change them because observation indicates that we have to.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's not true. Everything in this world has determined. All the results are generated by 'what is' in living reality. If you want to find the secret of this matter, then we just need to pick up only one thing among numerous phenomena. Then it's possible to observe it. Everything in the world which we can see from our physical eyes is applied by only one principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Can I ask, I mean I have to leave but what is the goal of coming to talk to the scientists?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Because I hope the science will be able to contribute for the benefit of humankind.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well you must understand the problem then. So he has to publish it. I can't understand the problem at this level.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> When we learn mathematics, the first step is to learn the numbers. When they learn the mathematics without learning the numbers, they have to learn that again.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Then he has to teach us even more. As I said, when it's harder, when it's more unusual, it's more difficult. And if it's going to be so different, then you need to then teach us the baby steps and go back to the baby steps. I'm sorry, I really have to go now.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We would like to interchange with you, so when you find anything curious or wondering, then please contact us with email.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> I have not learned by anyone. So if you point out any question (any matter) then I just see what is in your question and I just point out what are in the question.</p>
