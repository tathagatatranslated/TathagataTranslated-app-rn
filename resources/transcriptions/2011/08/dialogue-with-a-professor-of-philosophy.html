<div class='post_body'><p style=""><strong>Tathagata:</strong> I have been studying philosophy for a long, long time. So far, I'm not sure if my visiting will be helpful to you or not. I hope we will have a good time. If you have any questions, please let me know. When you do not understand what I speak, then please check again.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Professor in philosophy department:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> People in the past regarded philosophy as very, very important study. But people today are so indifferent about philosophy now. I may ask you some questions, but in case you don't know the right answer, don't be so ashamed. It's very important in our conversation to know as the first step what understanding we have in common. That's why I would like to ask you one question before we start our conversation. What is the definition of philosophy of today's scholars? How do you introduce philosophy to others?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> One of the interesting things about this field is that there isn't an agreed definition of what it is. And in fact, it's a philosophical question what it is. In other words, it's a question for philosophy what philosophy is. This is something that, well, philosophers usually wait until they're 60 years old or so to write about. So, I haven't tried to take a view on it, myself.</p>

<p style=""><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Haven't you defined it yet (the definition of philosophy)?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Haven't I defined it? No I haven't&hellip; Originally, philosophy was the search for knowledge or wisdom quite generally, but over time, as people have become more and more specialized, branches have broken off&nbsp; so that mathematics used to be part of philosophy, but now isn't, or the physical sciences used to be part of philosophy but now aren't. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Good answer. When you visit universities we can see signs to represent the work in university, is that it's the 'house for truth'. The work of the philosopher is to observe a variety of problems and search those matters. University is the place that they search academic research. The purpose of all the studies is to observe and research 'what is' in the problem. When you see this world in a simple way, we can speak about it in a simple way. But if we see this world in a very difficult way, the way of our talking will be always difficult. If people are not familiar to philosophy, even though they listen about something, they cannot understand 'what is' in what they heard. You said that physical science separated from original philosophy, but we should call it as the physical philosophy. Even though politics separated from philosophy, then we just call it as philosophy of politics, or political philosophy. I think myself very easy to answer to all your questions, so do you have any questions during your life so far, and do you have anything in particular that you really want to understand?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> You mean in my academic work, or in my personal life?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Anything. In your personal life, or in your academic research. If you have anything that you really want to understand, then please introduce. When I have your question, I teach you the way to see this world. When you know how to see this world, then like me, when you meet any strangers, you will not be stuck in talking. If somebody is familiar to philosophy, there's no level of question that is something difficult, that is easy. (There's no difference between questions.)</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> There's no difference between easy and difficult questions?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Yeah, there's no difference.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Because they're all easy?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> He said that if you are really master of philosophy then the difficulties of any questions are the same. You don't have difficult questions or easy questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> How about this one? It's in one of these books.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Oh, Plato.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The question is, How do people become virtuous?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> To have virtue.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> Virtue.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Can this be taught, or trained in some ways, or is it natural?</p>

<p style=""><strong>Soyun:</strong> Taught, or trained, or natural.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Three of things are possible (right answers) to make people virtuous. First, when they have virtue in their 'Motae' (Motae means the real origin), even though they are not taught, they are not trained, they live their life in virtue.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> First is that they have virtue in their motae (in their origin), Motae is Korean but if you want to know, ask him again about that term.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In order to understand Motae, you need some time. That's why if we have more correspondence (through email or something), then I'll explain enough to understand. In order to understand this term, we need a kind of object and I have to explain about a living example. Today we don't have enough time to explain that. Secondly, people cannot make themselves to be virtuous because they don't know the way how they can change themselves to be virtuous.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> So the second one is way, the path.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> Even though somebody commits a very bad conduct, but if they enlighten themselves and when they understand, what is in the knowledge, when they become to know what it is, then they can change their conduct.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Did you get it?</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So if someone understands reality,</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, 'what is' in reality</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> 'What is', if someone understands 'what is' in reality</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Then they can change themselves.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> When you say 'what is' in reality, do you mean when people understand the truth about morality especially, or the truth about 'what is' in their nature?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It means 'what is' in life. And third, it's possible for them to change good from training. In order to understand this problem (this question) we need to know how our consciousness was formed, and when we know how our already formed consciousness can be changed. So it is possible for us to change ourselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> That's why you suggested three things before to change so his answer is that three methods are possible to change - with this reason.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If you are interested really in this matter you need one year to understand this, and you should make questions continuously and have to observe the matter. When you understand properly about this matter, you will be able to be the best philosopher in this modern age. I am talking to you very confidently because, like a mathematician, when mathematician examines exactly the formula and the questions, then they can solve all the questions endlessly. It seems that now I meet a very good friend. If you have interest in me, then I will introduce all the principle how you can solve these matters. When you become to master with all this principle, you will solve all the matters by yourself like me. It's about one month since I started traveling in America. In Los Angeles, I wanted to meet a scientist who had the prize of the best scientist in 2004 in CalTech, but he was too busy so I didn't have a chance to meet him. When I refused to meet him, I started to see about his research (what did he study). I've heard that he wrote a paper about gravity and he was awarded by the paper. I met quite a lot of scientists who study gravity in several universities in America. Now I became the best one who knows of gravity in this world. Through several meetings I could see through them what they know. And I became to see things that they cannot perceive. In order to give evidence to others, we need to show others through a system, and we have to let people to see 'what is' in the matter. This is evidence. No scientist in America could show me the reality of their claims. Instead, I became to be able to show all the reality to them. I told you this episode (this story) for example. What Plato said in that book, could you give me another question? I'm very interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> So, other questions?</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Yes, or in another book, you have lots here&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well, let me follow-up on the question I already asked. Is it possible for someone to have knowledge of 'what is' but not be virtuous, or does knowledge guarantee the virtue?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> We need two dimensions to see the knowledge of human beings. One is natural. When we come to the world, we already have them in us. The other dimension of knowledge is that which comes from education (learning). We never show something through our behavior which is not in ourselves. So people can be a virtuous one only when they learn in case if they don't have that in their nature. We can find very interesting things when you study of Motae. It's almost impossible for the bad people to learn good, because something inside in them refuses. That's why it's very, very difficult for evil nature to receive good things. When we study this object, then we absolutely need the concrete object or matters so that we can observe and understand. In the world of math, we start from number 1, but we can make the endless number. In this world, we have numerous phenomena. We can solve all the questions by one principle. That's why in learning philosophy and teaching philosophy, the most important thing is the principle. But I haven't met anyone who wanted to learn this principle or who can teach this principle through any books, through anybody. If somebody becomes to know this principle, something bad in them will be disappeared. And from that time, good thing become to accumulate inside of them. Meanwhile, if somebody who doesn't have goodness in them but they want goodness to accumulate in them, then they must fight against 'what is' in themselves (in their Motae). And they must win. So what I speak is not mine. When you study our history, there's no one who really wanted to learn from the really excellent teachers.</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> When you have really great teacher, nobody really wanted to learn from them.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> In short introduction, our generation has four great greatest teachers. All of them were great philosophers. Through their teachings, we can find them, first was Gautama Buddha. He obtained (gained) a great Enlightenment and became to open his eyes to the world. When he was Enlightened, he tried to teach people goodness. But, people didn't come to him to learn in particular. That's why he was wandering the world until his age of 82 and he was looking for people who wanted to learn something good.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Well I'm surprised he says that because there are so many stories about him talking to the great assembly of thousands of people...</p>

<p style=""><strong>S:</strong> Thousands of people</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> The assembly of all the Bodhisattvas&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>*As Soyun translates, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> If there were people who wanted to listen to him, why he had to travel until 82 years and died on the street?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="">The second was Laotzu in China. Laotzu didn't learn much from others but he became the greater philosopher from what was in his Motae. He saw things in the world and when he tried to let people know what he saw, nobody came to him to learn. He was wandering all his life to find people but he had to die without any one disciple. Third, is Jesus. As soon as he opened his eyes to the world, he was killed by people before he taught his teaching properly to others. Fourth was Socrates. Socrates tried to let people know something good that he saw. But he didn't have students. He tried to introduce people what life they wanted, and he wanted to introduce how something good and bad happens in this world. But he didn't find any students. There's one person, Plato, who was interested in him, so after that he tried to introduce this teaching to others. I was very popular with people around me before I became a great philosopher. But when I became to open my eyes to the world, nobody come to me. That's why I had to start my traveling because I expected that my knowledge would be helpful to people in this world. (I'm looking for people.) I always requested them please ask me, but nobody ask me. And I always tell them, "I can show you what you want to see." But nobody requests me, "Please show me." This is the story of this world now. If you become to know about philosophy a little more, then you will understand why this thing happens in this world. I have only one thing to tell you. I don't have what I know, I don't have what I don't know. I become to know when I see the problem. But I don't know before I see problem. This is me. That's why I don't say that I know something or I don't know anything to people before that happens. But I don't have people who has interest in me especially.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Are you not students?</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It took a few decades to gain these few members. But you know, students come here with money to learn. I say am a greater philosopher, but if students come to me, when they don't have money I have to support them. This is difference. Sometimes people visit me. Most of them are poor, and very hardships. Sometimes the people come to me with their suffering and they ask me what is in their life. They have answer from me. But I haven't experienced that my answer were wrong. I believe that I give you correct answers to any kind of your questions because I can see 'what is' in your questions. So don't think of my circumstance. Whatever you are wondering, then please let me know. If I'm stuck to give answer to your questions then I'll invite you for dinner. Then you win the best. It's impossible for all the scholars in this world to compete to me. That's why I am very, very careful when I meet you. Because people find it very difficult and boring to listen to something that is outside of their vision. But I'm not sure you understand what I speak or not, but you could stand 50 minutes now.</p>

<p style=""><strong>Satto:</strong> Long time&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> That's why I would like to do something for you. So if you want, then I will solve any problems in your health or problems in your family, in your future, anything. Or problems in the society, you can ask me anything.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Can you offer a way to find peace in Iraq? The way to solve this war and violence&hellip;</p>

<p style=""><strong>T:</strong> It's very simple. In order to answer to this question, you need to show me what problems is in Iraq. There are lots of problems in Iraqi society. And all the answers of those variety of questions are different. If you ask me 1,000 questions about that issue within 10 minutes, then I'll answer to all your questions in 10 minutes. And I'll take responsibility of all my answers. When a mathematician has a mathematical problem, he will solve the problem on the formula. So if he finds the wrong answer, then it's the mistake of the mathematician. First, we need to recognize what is the problem in Iraq society. It's very easy for a person like me to solve the problem because all the answers are in their questions (problems). There are many of problems in this world and modern society is controlled by politicians. If there are some politicians who really want to be settled (peace in Iraq), then I would like to meet them and I'll help them to give this in Iraq's society. Meanwhile, I will not give solution to them if they have their own way of peace. If some people give me the authority (power) to govern Iraq, then I'll make the country to be peaceful within one month. In this world, nobody asked me about that, then how could I stand up and tell them I can make Iraq to be peaceful in this way. (I cannot say that&hellip;) You need quite time to understand the living reality.</p>

<p style=""><strong>P:</strong> Yes, of course&hellip;.</p>

<p style=""><strong>T: </strong>What is your wish? Don't see me as the ordinary person. If you tell me your wish, then at the moment your wish will come true 50%. But you will obtain 50% through your effort. I can promise this to you. You might never have met anybody who speaks like me. And nobody can tell you (like intellectuals) nobody can speak like me in front of a person like you who is intelligent. You'll be treated by people as an intelligent person when you mix with any people, they will say, "You are intelligent. You know something." I never ignore you so don't misunderstand that I speak very freely in front of you, because I'm very curious to you. I have lots of abilities the ordinary people don't have. I am always traveling around the world with no special sponsors -- individuals nor organizations don't sponsor me. I always travel but I don't work, but I always prepare my all expenses for my traveling. I don't have any problem in my family. This is quite different from others. It's impossible for me to make you understand in such a short time. I will appreciate to you if you ask me about things in the world if you want to know things in the world, or things in the future, things in yourself&hellip; please ask me then I'll appreciate that.</p>
