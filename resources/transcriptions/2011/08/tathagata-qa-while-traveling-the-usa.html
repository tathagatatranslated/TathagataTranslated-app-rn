<div class='post_body'><p><span style=""><strong>Q:</strong> Can Mr. Lee tell us a little more about what he does?</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>A:</strong> What I usually do is that I like to meet a variety of people, and I listen to them. I take their knowledge, and try to see the society from their eyesight as well. From those knowledge, I try to find some solution and alternative for the society. In some cases when people ask me about the solutions and answers, I also give them for their better life and better society.</span></p></div>
