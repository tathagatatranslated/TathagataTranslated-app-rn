A new world appeared in my calm mind.<br />
I saw myself,<br />
who had neither anguish nor fantasy.<br />
In my lonely heart,<br />
the sound of heaven was heard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Blessing 1</b><br />
<br />
All the things in the world are teachers.<br />
Meeting each one,<br />
I find that the meeting and separating have teachings.<br />
Everything in existence reciprocates.<br />
And pleasure lies in me,<br />
So blessing is like farming<br />
In keeping and practicing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Meanings of Heaven and Earth</b><br />
<br />
The meaning of bringing me up humbly<br />
Led me to dedicate myself to the world,<br />
The meaning of making me live with a lonely mind<br />
Let me know the great meaning of heaven.<br />
Looking over the time of eternity<br />
helped me forget the blessings and the ordeals.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Cause and Effect</b><br />
<br />
Mind makes world;<br />
World makes mind.<br />
I am the master of the world,<br />
The world is my teacher.<br />
When I and the world meet each other,<br />
It lets me know the past and the future.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Good Deeds 1 (The Essence of Buddha)</b><br />
<br />
Conscience must be like a high mountain,<br />
And courage must reach heaven.<br />
Accordingly, as I go over and over a mind of suffering,<br />
A single beautiful mind blooms in the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Sound of Heaven</b><br />
<br />
If you know the truth, you will be all alone;<br />
If you speak the truth, you will be under a curse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Virtue 1</b><br />
<br />
Keep<br />
Practice<br />
And love.<br />
