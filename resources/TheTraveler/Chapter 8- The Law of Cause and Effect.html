The law of cause and effect is the eternal promise that exists in our world.<br />
We call this promise truth.<br />
I will explain things of the world by this law.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Five Blessings of the World</b><br />
<br />
One is the mind that repents.<br />
One is the mind that prays.<br />
One is the mind that wants to know truth.<br />
One is the mind that serves.<br />
One is the mind that delivers the meaning.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Words of a Lonely Man</b><br />
<br />
The reason why people do not know me<br />
Is that my words are humble.<br />
The reason why people in the future come to know me<br />
Is that my words are true.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Virtue 2</b><br />
<br />
Not trying to enlighten the blind's mind<br />
Is abandoning my virtue;<br />
Awakening their sleep<br />
Is making me lonely.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Blessing 2</b><br />
<br />
If you abandon three greeds,<br />
You will be able to bless yourself;<br />
If you earn three good things,<br />
You will be able to bless the world.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>An Eye to See Truth</b><br />
<br />
The eye with 20/20 vision<br />
Can see all the things<br />
That the eye with 20/2 vision can see.<br />
But in the same conditions<br />
The eye with 20/2 vision<br />
Can not see all the things<br />
That the eye with 20/20 vision see.<br />
The mind is like this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Example</b><br />
<br />
People do not stay<br />
Near a true man<br />
Just as fish do not play<br />
In clean water<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Way</b><br />
<br />
The way [Do, 道] that a wrong person teaches<br />
Is just to embellish a heard story.<br />
The way [Do, 道] of a good person<br />
Is just to see everyday life which is close by.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Way and Virtue</b><br />
<br />
There being no peace in the world<br />
Is due to there being no way;<br />
There being no happiness in the world<br />
Is due to there being no virtue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Greed</b><br />
<br />
If your mind is dark<br />
you will lose discernment;<br />
If you seek the way [Do, 道] with greed<br />
You will get disaster.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Disaster and Blessing</b><br />
<br />
The origins of all the diseases lie in the mind;<br />
The origins of all the blessings lie in the body.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Asceticism</b><br />
<br />
If you are aware of virtue, you will fear attachment and greed;<br />
If you quit attachment and greed, you come to know the things of the world.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Destiny</b><br />
<br />
Even if you only live one single day<br />
You will have to cherish your life.<br />
Life is connected to the destiny of your endless future.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Law</b><br />
<br />
A bright world exists under the fair law;<br />
A dark world exists under a wrong law.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Good Essence</b><br />
<br />
A mind without good essence<br />
Is colorblind.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Truth</b><br />
<br />
Truth always exists.<br />
The reason why a person cannot see even the facts which are put in front of him<br />
Is that the person does not have a good mind.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Teaching</b><br />
<br />
The words of the enlightened man are like running water;<br />
The words of a stupid man are like stagnant water.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Origin</b><br />
<br />
The greatest way [Do, 道]<br />
Means what returns to the very starting point.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Truth</b><br />
<br />
When you are to know facts<br />
First you must see their causes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Discernment</b><br />
<br />
When you try to see a good thing<br />
First you must make a good cause;<br />
When you try to escape a wrong thing<br />
You must not make trouble.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Wall</b><br />
<br />
A man who opens his eyes sees the blind;<br />
The blind can not see a man who opens his eyes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Result</b><br />
<br />
An ignorant person comes to lose the self;<br />
A man who does not make an effort comes to lose the world.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Mind</b><br />
<br />
Accordingly as good meanings are piled up<br />
A bright mind comes into being;<br />
Accordingly as attachment is piled up<br />
A dark mind comes into being.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Cause</b><br />
<br />
You can see a true mind when you know the things of the world;<br />
You can see a stupid mind when you have a greed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Precept</b><br />
<br />
Those who had killed an innocent man<br />
made six million of their descendants give up their lives.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>What I See Through Living</b><br />
<br />
Conscience makes oneself shine,<br />
Justice makes the world shine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Advice and Humility</b><br />
<br />
Advice is like a tonic;<br />
Humility is like treasure.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Flattery and Arrogance</b><br />
<br />
Flattery is like opium;<br />
Arrogance is like poison.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Behavior</b><br />
<br />
If I did not do what I have to do<br />
It would become my own unhappiness;<br />
If I did not keep what I have to keep<br />
It would become the world's unhappiness.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Blessing 3</b><br />
<br />
Among what you get from the world<br />
The greatest blessing<br />
Is to know yourself.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Evidence</b><br />
<br />
Truth [Way] exists in facts;<br />
Truths are its evidence<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Living</b><br />
<br />
An enlightened man does not have affection;<br />
A stupid man does not have right and wrong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Difference Between the True Way and the Evil Way</b><br />
<br />
Those who believe in the true way think highly of facts;<br />
Those who believe in the evil way do not.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Minds of a Big-Hearted Man and a Small-Hearted Man</b><br />
<br />
The life of a great person [大人] displays stinginess towards the self;<br />
The life of a bad person [小人] displays stinginess towards others.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Faith</b><br />
<br />
Faith is the belief in the truth [眞理].<br />
Faith without the truth causes a mind to be sick.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Way of an Enlightened Being&nbsp;[道人]</b><br />
<br />
When you try to awaken the world, there are conflicts;<br />
If you know the way [Do, 道], you experience things which make you feel lonely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Relativeness</b><br />
<br />
The solitude of a true person originates from knowing sins;<br />
The reason why stupid people deserted the true person is that they do not know any sins.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Way of a Truthful Person</b><br />
<br />
What’s harder<br />
Than becoming the object of the mockery of tens of thousands of people<br />
Is to deceive just one stupid person.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>That Meaning</b><br />
<br />
The reason why the road of hell is full is that minds are dark;<br />
The reason why the road of heaven is solitary is that the world is dark.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Sin</b><br />
<br />
You come to know the biggest blessings through enlightenment;<br />
The biggest sins come out through ignorance.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Natural Consequences of One's Own Deeds</b><br />
<br />
While alive, those who bear others' burdens<br />
Take off their own burdens after death;<br />
While alive, those who hide their own burdens<br />
Add more burdens and bear them after death.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Words of the Enlightened Being</b><br />
<br />
Those who open their eyes see the world;<br />
Those who close their eyes see illusion.<br />
The reason why people do not follow the enlightened being<br />
is that the teaching is only facts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Among What Has Existed so Far</b><br />
<br />
The righteous one is born by the meaning of heaven;<br />
The world blooms by the law of cause and effect.<br />
