Where should I meet the true world?<br />
<div>
I did not have the place to ask it.</div>
<div>
I would rather have wished</div>
<div>
That the dark time was a dream.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>House of Illusion</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
There is not he.</div>
<div>
But there exists only his name.</div>
<div>
There is no truth,</div>
<div>
But there exists only its sound.</div>
<div>
Having built a house of illusion,</div>
<div>
A man who invited the blind.</div>
<div>
There is hidden disaster</div>
<div>
In the stagnant water.<br />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<b>The Words That Told Me to Abandon Justice</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
I am very upset now.</div>
<div>
It happened this morning.</div>
<div>
My wife told me to forget everything.</div>
<div>
But I could not forget a single word.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<b><br /></b>
<b><br /></b>
<b>Evil In-Yeon</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
Human beings!</div>
<div>
Do not make me speak of</div>
<div>
Courage and truth now.</div>
<div>
Too exhausted to wait,</div>
<div>
I became another person.</div>
<div>
Getting away from a god of destiny</div>
<div>
That is building an evil In-Yeon,</div>
<div>
I am hiding myself in the crowd of open-eyed blind people,</div>
<div>
Even though you happen to see me now,</div>
<div>
Don't say that you know me.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<b><br /></b>
<b><br /></b>
<b>Mirage</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
Bigger than the shout of the Jews</div>
<div>
And stronger than the rage of the German people.</div>
<div>
Those who have built an evil In-Yeon and dance!</div>
<div>
Do you know the secret of the mirage?</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<b><br /></b>
<b><br /></b>
<b>Sound</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
Having heard the sound of time</div>
<div>
That drove away the darkness of the pitch-black night,</div>
<div>
Somebody dreams of a poet.</div>
<div>
Ah!</div>
<div>
Silence.</div>
<div>
As if the fire of the heart went out,</div>
<div>
The song of destiny is heard in the dark world.</div>
<div>
Night!</div>
<div>
Night!</div>
<div>
Deep night!</div>
<div>
Now I close my eyes,</div>
<div>
And try to sleep,</div>
<div>
Do not wake up</div>
<div>
Despair in my mind.<br />
<br /></div>
