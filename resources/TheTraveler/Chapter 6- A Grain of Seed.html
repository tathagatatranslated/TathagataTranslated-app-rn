Soyun.<br />
This is the name<br />
That I gave to the world for the first time.<br />
After having given this name,<br />
I told her all my secrets.<br />

<b>The Poem Dedicated to Soyun</b><br />
<br />
Soyun.<br />
A flower<br />
That blooms in a lonely heart.<br />
Does morning dawn<br />
In a mind which is wet with dew?<br />
For a bright world,<br />
I am to bloom you as a beam of light,<br />
So I want to fill you with all my wisdom.<br />
I thought of a red rose,<br />
I pictured a white lily,<br />
But I wanted to bloom<br />
A small lotus blossom.<br />
<br />
Soyun.<br />
For the world,<br />
When you bloomed to be lonely,<br />
For the world,<br />
when you were in an agony<br />
I wanted to call the flower Soyun<br />
That bloomed<br />
Against such a big ordeal.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Wall 1</b><br />
<br />
The meaning of heaven and earth blooms<br />
In a person's mind;<br />
The beautiful light<br />
feels fearful and sorrowful indeed.<br />
I saw what had happened for thousands of years,<br />
And I invited others proudly.<br />
However,<br />
How high the wall of the mind is!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Way</b><br />
<br />
I<br />
Write a piece of poetry<br />
Here,<br />
Walking the road of ordeals.<br />
A man who knows my poems<br />
Opens his soul’s eye.<br />
The way [Do, 道] exists in the world<br />
And virtue [Deok, 德] exists in a person,<br />
Meeting and separating,<br />
Is there anything to learn from you?<br />
How profound!<br />
There exists the way of heaven and earth<br />
in a human being's mind.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Land of Promise&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
In the country with the East Sea,<br />
There are three gods'-mountains,<br />
Grudge has bloomed over five thousand years.<br />
A solitary mind bloomed at that place,<br />
Which made known the way to the new world.<br />
