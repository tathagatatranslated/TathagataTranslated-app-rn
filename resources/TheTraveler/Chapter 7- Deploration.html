This is the song<br />
Which I have been singing,<br />
Seeing myself, the one who has no place to go and stay.<br />
Heaven! Please let me find righteous people today.<br />
And please let them cause a new world to come into being.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>A Man Who Finds a Righteous Man</b><br />
<br />
I was not a man among the people of a devil,<br />
But I was the king of good men.<br />
I came through the lonely time by myself,<br />
I am wandering and looking for a ’Nim’ [님, i.e. a truth seeker].<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>The Work That Creates a New World</b><br />
<br />
Turning round and round is the meaning of creation.<br />
The earth splits and the waterway overturns,<br />
The meaning of which makes the world exist.<br />
The only thing that a man with his eyes open can do is to worry,<br />
How deep the dreams of the blind are!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Conscience</b><br />
<br />
I am not guilty,<br />
however,<br />
Whose is this mind which is so fearful?<br />
When I pray<br />
With a beautiful meaning,<br />
How unkind the world is!<br />
Having born his cross<br />
Up Golgotha Hill,<br />
An innocent man!<br />
I envied you.<br />
I am bearing a big burden,<br />
So I can not desert ordeals yet,<br />
My desolate mind is far and far,<br />
But who in the world has known me<br />
In an impatient time?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Ownerless Treasure</b><br />
<br />
There is nobody who knows my lonely mind,<br />
There is nowhere my steps can go to, as the day dawns.<br />
Knowing the greatest treasure of the world,<br />
I am waiting and looking for its owners, only to fail to find them.<br />
