There is something we can not believe in the world.<br />
However, as time goes by, people come to know such a thing.<br />
And then it is clear that truth and falsehood can be proven by a fact.<br />
<br />
Who are you?<br />
&gt; I am a Tathagata.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by a Tathagata?<br />
&gt; I am the world. (I am the person who awakens the world)<br />
<br />
What is the difference between a world which awakens and a world which does not awaken?<br />
&gt; It is the difference between people seeing with their eyes open, and with their eyes closed.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between the one who can see and the one who can’t?<br />
&gt; It is the truth.<br />
<br />
Where does truth exist?<br />
&gt; It is in facts.<br />
<br />
Are you an enlightened being?<br />
&gt; Yes, I am.<br />
<br />
What is the proof that you are enlightened?<br />
&gt; The proof is in my mind.<br />
<br />
What is your mind like?<br />
&gt; It is the mind that sees facts.<br />
<br />
Where are facts?<br />
&gt; Anywhere.<br />
<br />
Do you call yourself an enlightened being and a Tathagata?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
How did you know that you were a Tathagata?<br />
&gt; It is because I was also a Tathagata in the past.<br />
<br />
What is the proof that you were a Tathagata in the past?<br />
&gt; It is the present.<br />
<br />
If that is so, do you know what you will be like in the future?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
By what can you prove the past, and by what can you prove the future?<br />
&gt; The present.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by the present?<br />
&gt; I mean that the present came from the past, and that the future comes from the present.<br />
<br />
If that is so, how could we know such things?<br />
&gt; You get to know them by seeing the world.<br />
<br />
Do you see the world?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
What do you see in the world?<br />
&gt; The law of cause and effect.<br />
<br />
What does the law of cause and effect explain?<br />
&gt; It explains 'I', and 'what exists in front of me'.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by 'I' and 'what exists in front of me'?<br />
&gt; 'I' means myself, and 'what exists in front of me' means the world.<br />
<br />
What is the relationship between I and the world?<br />
&gt; I have the cause which makes the environment in the world, the world has the effect which I try to get.<br />
<br />
Do you believe that the things of the world appear by human beings and that the things of human beings appear by the world?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
Then, do you believe that God exists?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
You call yourself an enlightened being; what is the reason that you, as the enlightened being, believe that God exists?<br />
&gt; It is for my own benefit.<br />
<br />
What difference do I have when I believe that God exists or not?<br />
&gt; When I believe that God exists, I can get a good mind and keep it easily; when I do not believe that God exists, it is difficult to get a good mind and keep it.<br />
<br />
What is a good mind like?<br />
&gt; It means conscience, justice, and love.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between someone who has a good mind and who does not?<br />
&gt; The result.<br />
<br />
What is the result of having a good mind?<br />
&gt; The result of having a good mind means that you can see eternal life and heaven (the blessed land) due to enlightenment; a wrong mind comes to have grudges, to be born as an animal, and to go through hell due to the mind’s darkness.<br />
<br />
Do you believe that people's minds can change the things of the world and that the things of the world can change people's minds?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
If so, why don’t people who are aware of such things try to enlighten themselves along with you?<br />
&gt; That is because they still don't know the things of the world<br />
<br />
You conclude that people don't see their mind, how can we believe that?<br />
&gt; I know that by seeing them.<br />
<br />
What is the proof that you know that by seeing them?<br />
&gt; It is their view to see facts. People who have dark minds can’t see what is just in front of themselves, but people who have bright minds can see things from a distance.<br />
<br />
Then what makes it possible to determine whether a mind is a dark or a bright one?<br />
&gt; It is personality.<br />
<br />
In reality, what does a personality look like and what makes you say that you know their mind?<br />
&gt; When a good mind hears facts, it tends to recognize truth as much as the brightness and when a bad mind hears facts, it tends not to recognize as much as the darkness.<br />
<br />
Do you believe you can prove all the things about the world and about people?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
If so can you prove the things which happened in the past?<br />
&gt; Somethings are possible, others are not possible.<br />
<br />
What is possible, and what is impossible?<br />
&gt; If the handed-down record is about the world, even now we can prove something of it; If the record is not based on the truth, we can not.<br />
<br />
Then what was Buddha like in the past?<br />
&gt; He was an enlightened man.<br />
<br />
Did he call himself a Tathagata?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
What is the proof that he was a Tathagata?<br />
&gt; The proof is in Buddhist scripture.<br />
<br />
What is written in it?<br />
&gt; It is about the world.<br />
<br />
How can we recognize the world?<br />
&gt; You can understand it through the law of cause and effect.<br />
<br />
Then what was Jesus like when we see by way of the law of cause and effect?<br />
&gt; He was a true man.<br />
<br />
What was the proof that he was a true man?<br />
&gt; His mind, words, and behavior.<br />
<br />
Then what is the proof?<br />
&gt; It is the New Testament.<br />
<br />
Are your words trustworthy?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
Nowadays there are appearances of men who claim the name of Jesus. Who are they?<br />
&gt; I do not know.<br />
<br />
What is the proof that they are not Jesus?<br />
&gt; It is in their words and behaviors.<br />
<br />
Then does Jesus have proof?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
What is it?<br />
&gt; His words, his behavior, and the physical characteristics that he has.<br />
The words expain the law of cause and effect, the behavior avoids five desires, which means that he does not want alcohol, meat, sexual passion, wealth, nor fame. His physical characteristics are described as a splendid physique. He possesses the eye of the soul, and has a sort of bead in the middle of his forehead.<br />
<br />
Shakyamuni Buddha prophesied Maitreya in the future and Jesus as Messiah at the end of the world. Who are Maitreya and Messiah?<br />
&gt; They are the same.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by the end of the world?<br />
&gt; It means that we will have a changing period.<br />
<br />
What is a changing period?<br />
&gt; All the civilizations at present will disappear and a new world will emerge.<br />
<br />
What kinds of measures can we take for the new world?<br />
&gt; You have to save yourselves.<br />
<br />
What is the way to save ourselves?<br />
&gt; It is truth.<br />
<br />
Will the Messiah come and save us in this world during the changing period?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
When will he appear in the world?<br />
&gt; He has appeared already.<br />
<br />
How can we meet him?<br />
&gt; You can meet him if you open your eyes to the truth.<br />
