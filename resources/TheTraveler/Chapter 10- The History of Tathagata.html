Truth exists forever.<br />
If apples do not look like apples,<br />
If apples do not taste like apple<br />
We can not call them apples.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
I did not notice you are a Tathagata when I saw you.<br />
&gt; Right.<br />
<br />
Where do you think there is the reason why people do not recognize you as a Tathagata when people meet you?<br />
&gt; It is in the mind.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between the mind with your sight and the mind with people's?<br />
&gt; It is like the reason that the one of bright mind identifies easily the facts in stories just heard in passing, and the one of dark mind does not know the truths in facts, even despite looking into those facts with their own eyes.<br />
<br />
Then what is the secret of brightening up our minds which enables us to see the facts?<br />
&gt; It is to enlighten yourselves about the truth of goodness and to not forget it.<br />
<br />
If we are to learn and understand the meaning even now, where can we learn and see it?<br />
&gt; You can learn and see it in your daily life.<br />
<br />
When someone believes what you said above, follows you, and wants to learn from you, would you teach them all the things you know?<br />
&gt; Yes, I would.<br />
<br />
If they want to become Buddha in their present life by following what you say, could you help them see Buddha's mind?<br />
&gt; I cannot tell that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by that?<br />
&gt; Results come out through processes. It is not right to tell results in advance without confirming the process.<br />
<br />
What can you do for them in this era?<br />
&gt; I can teach them the way of cause and effect when they want.<br />
<br />
Is no one else able to do the same things as you?<br />
&gt; No, they aren’t.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between you and them?<br />
&gt; It is the truth.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between your truth and their truths?<br />
&gt; It is the difference between the one who can see and those who cannot.<br />
<br />
What is different between the one and the others?<br />
&gt; When you hear the same words, it is easy to understand them if they are said by the one who can see the world; it is difficult to know the truthfulness of facts if they are said by those who cannot.<br />
<br />
Through what process did you see the Buddha's way?<br />
&gt; Firstly, I attained a good mind, secondly, I came to meet lonely things endlessly, and thirdly, I deserted myself.<br />
<br />
Is it impossible for anybody else to see Buddha without going through the above process?<br />
&gt; Yes, it is.<br />
<br />
What is the proof of your saying yes?<br />
&gt; Up until now, there have been a lot of ascetic devotees in the world. However, the reason why even until now a Buddha hasn’t yet appeared among them is that the way to becoming a Buddha is far and strict.<br />
<br />
In this period, if someone says that they have made up their mind to succeed in seeing the way, do you believe that it is still impossible?<br />
&gt; No, I don’t.<br />
<br />
What kind of teaching can you give to them?<br />
&gt; Firstly, they must awaken their mind, then see their mind, and finally achieve good things in actual fact.<br />
<br />
What is a good thing?<br />
&gt; It is to keep one’s truthfulness and accomplish it.<br />
<br />
We do not know anything, moreover, how on earth can we know our own truthfulness?<br />
&gt; Right. You are bound to see it when you serve the world.<br />
<br />
What result can the one who serves the world get?<br />
&gt; The one will get virtue.<br />
<br />
What is virtue?<br />
&gt; It means that good mind is created.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between the one with virtue and without?<br />
&gt; It is like the difference of eyesight when we see things.<br />
<br />
If someone accumulates virtue truly and wants to see the world, can any such person see the world?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
What is the positive proof to support what you have said so far?<br />
&gt; You will see the proof after you serve the world with your sincerity.<br />
<br />
Thank you. Now, I have learned many things from you. But I have not known your history. Could you tell me your background now?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
Who is your master who has taught you and what kind of ascetic practice did you do?<br />
&gt; I taught myself. Even though I tell you the process of my ascetic practices, it is difficult for you to understand it unless you experience it yourself. But I can tell you one thing without hiding at all. It takes lots of time and effort for a human being to get a good mind through the world and to become Buddha with that mind.<br />
<br />
Then, is this the story based on your experience?<br />
&gt; Yes, it was a long time ago. I was able to attain a good mind from the world.<br />
<br />
What is the good mind that you described?<br />
&gt; It is conscience and courage by way of current expression.<br />
<br />
Do you believe that Buddha's way started with conscience and courage?<br />
&gt; Yes.<br />
<br />
What is this result of the conscience and courage of which you have spoken?<br />
&gt; After I saw conscience, I could take care of myself; after I saw courage, I could live rightly along with the things in the world.<br />
<br />
What is the result of your keeping yourself and taking care of the world?<br />
&gt; I could be free from reincarnation by my virtue, and owing to this, I came to get eternal life.<br />
<br />
Does that mean your body never dies and exists forever?<br />
&gt; No. My body has changed countlessly. However, my soul has never been scattered and has stayed without changing. Thus I could be born again and over again with the original mind. Nevertheless, the reason why my mind could not be Buddha's mind is that my virtue could not reach that of Buddha. When I tried to know Buddha's way, my body got so old that I died. When I was born again, naturally I came to meet another world. Finally as my virtue came to know Buddha's way, the world made me climb over enormous suffering. One of the tests was to let me enjoy wealth and fame. The world made me be born surrounded by alcoholic drink, women, and meat, and seduced me to forget what had happened in my past with affection and music. However, I was not able to be contented in such surroundings. Among people, no one knew the questions which had accumulated in my mind. One day, I happened to see another world which was different from mine. In the world, there were some people of low birth who had come, some people who had become emaciated from hunger, and others who were dying of diseases. It was not until then that I had seen the questions in my mind.<br />
&nbsp; That made me discard my small duty (affection) and hit the road to serve the world's duty (truthfulness). However, there was no one who has known the right way in front of me, and this frustrated mind had to wander around the world. The more I listened to the people, the less I could know truth and facts. Wherever I went, I could not meet any teachers.<br />
&nbsp; At last I got a clue. It was that I hear of things through myself.<br />
&nbsp; Even then, the only thing I knew was confidence. I had such a burning enthusiasm to seek out truth and to accumulate virtue in the world that I could fight against coldness, hunger, loneliness, and despair. However, time resulted in nothing.<br />
&nbsp; At one moment I saw myself having neither will nor expectation for the first time. My body began to be full of the same silence as seen from the world of death. After a while, the message from heaven was heard through my mind. Since that incident, regardless of what I saw in the world, agony has not gather. Even though time went by, fantasy did not arise. It was not until then that I realized that a mind with nothing is Buddha's mind.<br />
&nbsp; However, people did not believe my words, and did not want to follow me either, because they had never seen Buddha before. From that time on, I began to see myself who was lonely and this kind of thing let me know what I should do in the world. Immediately, five desires in myself disappeared, my mind became as bright as clear sky, and when my mind reached all the things in the world, I could see the meaning of them. I started to look for people and to preach the law of cause and effect, and I allowed people to call me a Tathagata.<br />
&nbsp; Now, whoever wants to be the same as I should truly not forget what happened to me, and should know what is right or wrong in themselves. If they want to know the result of all the things in the world, they should understand the law of cause and effect.<br />
&nbsp; Whoever wants to know this law should have the very mind [Buddha’s mind] and it will be possible for them to see the law after having served the world. I should say that a good root [origin] is the origin of Buddha.<br />
