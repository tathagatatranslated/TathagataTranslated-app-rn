Heaven burdened me.<br />
Nobody could bear that burden rather than me.<br />
So I had to wander around the world again.<br />
<br />

<b>Traveler</b><br />
<br />
I am a traveler,<br />
A traveler who shoulders,<br />
A traveler who bears<br />
A brilliantly shining sack of treasure.<br />
<br />
I am a traveler,<br />
A traveler who shoulders,<br />
Who bears a sack of treasure,<br />
Visiting from far, far away.<br />
<br />
I am a traveler,<br />
A traveler who shoulders,<br />
A traveler who bears a sack of treasure,<br />
Going and looking for a lonely Nim [님, lover/sir/lord, i.e. an owner for the treasure].<br />
<br />
I am a traveler,<br />
A traveler who shoulders,<br />
A traveler who visit the world<br />
To look for the owner of this treasure.<br />

<b>The Way of Enlightenment</b><br />
<br />
When I go beyond my mind,<br />
There is a world.<br />
When I go beyond the world,<br />
There is heaven and the earth.<br />
Who is there?<br />
In the vast sky and earth,<br />
What is emptiest of all<br />
Is the mind with no mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Buddha Who Has Come to the World</b><br />
<br />
The pure mind is like a mirror,<br />
The five desires have left the body.<br />
The world is like a picture in a dream, however,<br />
There is no friend in heaven nor on the ground.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Anguish</b><br />
<br />
The timespan of a day is too dreadful;<br />
The timespan of a year is in vain.<br />
For whom<br />
Am I aware of things of a life which is full of agony?<br />
With sorry happenings under my eyes,<br />
Today, having no place to go<br />
makes me burn my sorry mind.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>True Person [眞人]</b><br />
<br />
In my mind,<br />
There is fairness and justice,<br />
And courage<br />
That has loved the world.<br />
And I have no place to say them,<br />
So I am strolling<br />
In my lonely mind alone everyday.<br />
<br />
I am not Nietzsche,<br />
I am not Jesus,<br />
And I am not Socrates.<br />
When my body wanted to desert suffering,<br />
Only my precious mind<br />
Knew the meaning of heaven,<br />
And made me live a lonely time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Emancipation</b><br />
<br />
Having burned the heart over and over again,<br />
The world made me see mind.<br />
All the meanings of heaven and earth are shining<br />
In the place where there is no anguish nor fantasy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The World</b><br />
<br />
The road of the world along which people come and go<br />
Is the place where burdens are shouldered and un-shouldered.<br />
The long, long way of destiny<br />
Also resides in oneself.<br />
Stupidity becomes a burden,<br />
The bright mind becomes a meaning,<br />
So the entire life of humanity<br />
Is like a dream on a summer night.<br />
