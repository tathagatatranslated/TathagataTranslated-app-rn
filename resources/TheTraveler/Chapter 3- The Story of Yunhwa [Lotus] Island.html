An innocent man had to see a sin<br />
Was heaven's meaning.<br />
Because there was no place to hide his mind,<br />
He who had to confine himself to a solitary island<br />
Lamented as following.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Letter Sent to the Fatherland</b><br />
<br />
What should I do?<br />
What should I do?<br />
Even though I know your destiny,<br />
Not being able to tell you,<br />
What should I do?<br />
If I try to live with my eyes closed,<br />
I fear heaven's meaning.<br />
If I try to live with my eyes open,<br />
I fear the things of the world.<br />
What should I do?<br />
What should I do?<br />
Having no place to hide shame and rage,<br />
What should I do<br />
with my anxious mind?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Deploration</b><br />
<br />
Having formed clouds up in the sky,<br />
Is it raining or blowing tomorrow.<br />
The world’s human mind is dark,<br />
So I do not know a single day's work.<br />
Oh, oh, solitary time!<br />
A man's mind has no place to go,<br />
Hiding himself in a small island<br />
That blue waves enclose,<br />
Seeing the sky,<br />
A day comes and just goes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Repentance</b><br />
<br />
Let us cry with a loving mind.<br />
Let us cry with a lonely mind.<br />
Let us cry facing the silence to have justice fall asleep.<br />
Let us cry like rain,<br />
Let us cry like the waters in rivers.<br />
Let us cry looking at the sky,<br />
Let us cry looking at the ground.<br />
Seeing the mind of this land's people,<br />
Like a dark sea,<br />
Like a devil's hell,<br />
Let us cry together.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Exile</b><br />
<br />
I am a free man.<br />
My body is like the lord's of the castle,<br />
My mind is like a sinner's.<br />
I hung my heart’s ambition<br />
At the main entrance.<br />
At an isolated place on a small island,<br />
Even a friend is not visiting,<br />
The walls are keeping and watching me.<br />
When I see myself<br />
Cooking and doing the laundry,<br />
Somebody is washing pebbles outdoors.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Waterway</b><br />
<br />
When there have come nights<br />
With no sounds of waves nor wind,<br />
I sat up all night long<br />
Thinking of my lover [or 'country'].<br />
When the burning fire rises<br />
In my heart,<br />
And I try to ask the waterway,<br />
The stars are smiling.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Waiting</b><br />
<br />
Flowers bloom<br />
Leaves sprout,<br />
So has spring come?<br />
Trees and plants!<br />
Has spring come to just you?<br />
I had a dream<br />
In my childhood,<br />
It was what I waited for<br />
When day was dawning by the window.<br />
Flowers bloom<br />
Leaves sprout,<br />
So has spring come?<br />
Trees and plants!<br />
Has spring come to just you?<br />
<br />
